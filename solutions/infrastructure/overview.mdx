This section covers the core building blocks you can mix and match or use together as a complete scalable backend for onchain apps.

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Indexer" href="/solutions/indexer/overview">
    Real-time balances, transfers, prices, and contract events across EVM chains. Low-latency reads with webhooks and event subscriptions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transaction API" href="/solutions/infrastructure/transaction-api">
    Unified relayer/dispatcher for sending transactions with gas sponsorship, batching, and parallel nonces. Compatible with any EVM contract.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Blockchain RPC" href="/solutions/infrastructure/blockchain-rpc">
    High-availability node access via the Sequence Node Gateway. Health-checked, auto-routed RPC across providers with minimal config.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sidekick" href="/solutions/infrastructure/sidekick">
    Dockerized backend for secure key management and standardized read/write endpoints (e.g., mint, transfer) using Sequence infrastructure.
  </Card>

## How these fit together

- **Read fast with Indexer**; subscribe to changes via **Webhooks** or **Event Subscriptions**.  
- **Write reliably with Transaction API** using gas sponsorship, optimal gas pricing, and automatic resubmits.  
- **Call contracts or libraries directly** through **Blockchain RPC** when you need raw node access.  
- **Run server-side flows** with **Sidekick** for secure key custody and simplified endpoints, or build your own server with our SDKs.
