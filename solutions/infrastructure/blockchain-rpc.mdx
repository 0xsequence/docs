**Blockchain RPC** is a load balanced raw node access service. It provides health-checked, load-balanced **RPC endpoints** per network and automatically fails over across multiple providers.

## Usage

1. Setup your project in [Builder](/solutions/builder/getting-started) and obtain your **Project Access Key**.
2. Use the Node Gateway URL pattern in your client or server:

```txt
https://nodes.sequence.app/<chain_handle>
```

<Info>
For a full list of chain handles, see [supported networks & status](https://status.sequence.info). You can also use the Blockchain RPC section in [Builder](https://sequence.build/) to get the right URL for your project, prepopulated with your access key.
</Info>

**Example (ethers v6):**

```ts
import { JsonRpcProvider } from 'ethers'

const provider = new JsonRpcProvider('https://nodes.sequence.app/base') // Chain handle from status page
const block = await provider.getBlockNumber()
```

## Notes

- The Node Gateway automatically routes to healthy providers and keeps data **in-sync**.  
- Works alongside **Indexer** for higher-level reads and **Transaction API** for writes.  
- You can monitor usage and configure access keys in Builder, including request access restrictions.

## Performance

Sequence Blockchain RPC is engineered to power high-demand and high-availability apps. It aggregates multiple node providers, auto-switching between them to ensure correct and in sync data availability â€” giving you the assurance that your decentralized applications run smoothly with low latency for your users.

No need to worry about peak traffic. Our node infrastructure is robust, offering higher scalability and fault tolerance. Additionally, we provide automatic node failure detection and recovery.
