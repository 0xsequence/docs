description: Dockerized backend that exposes standardized blockchain read/write endpoints with secure key management, built on Sequence infrastructure.
sidebarTitle: Overview
---

**Sidekick** is a dockerized backend you can run to perform blockchain reads/writes through simple HTTP endpoints while keeping **private keys** off the client. It integrates with Sequence services (Indexer, Transactions API, Node Gateway) and can hold keys locally or via KMS.

## What it's for

- **Server-side write flows** (e.g., mint ERC-1155/721, transfer, airdrops).  
- **Secure key custody** with local files, AWS KMS, or GCP KMS.  
- **Simple HTTP endpoints** so your app doesn't need to embed signing logic.

## High-level setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run the container">
    Start Sidekick via Docker; configure environment variables for your access keys, networks, and key storage (local or KMS).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get the smart account">
    Retrieve the Sidekick smart account address from the `/sidekick/smart-account-address` endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Grant permissions">
    Grant <code>MINTER_ROLE</code> (or transfer ownership) on your contracts to the Sidekick account, depending on your access control model.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Call endpoints">
    Use write endpoints (e.g., <code>/write/erc1155/`{chainId}`/`{contract address}`/mint</code>) and read endpoints as needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quickstart

There is a public docker image available on [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/0xsequence/sidekick/pkgs/container/sidekick).

```shell
docker run -p 7500:7500 -e SEQUENCE_PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY=... ghcr.io/0xsequence/sidekick:latest
```

This will get you started with a local Sidekick backend running on port 7500 with the minimal features.

<Note>
We recommend setting SEQUENCE_PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY as well but for testing purposes we provide a default one, you can get yours from [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build/).
</Note>

To do a full setup, you can follow the [quickstart guide](/solutions/infrastructure/sidekick/quickstart).
