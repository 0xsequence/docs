There is a public docker image available on [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/0xsequence/sidekick/pkgs/container/sidekick).

```shell
docker run -p 7500:7500 -e SEQUENCE_PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY=... ghcr.io/0xsequence/sidekick:latest
```

This will get you started with a local Sidekick backend running on port 7500 with the minimal features.

<Note>
We recommend setting SEQUENCE_PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY as well but for testing purposes we provide a default one, you can get yours from [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build/).
</Note>

## Backend wallet

Sidekick creates a Sequence Smart Contract Wallet based on the `BACKEND_WALLET_PV_KEY` or `AWS / GCP KMS` signer you provide, this allows gas-sponsorship, batching and other optimizations.

To configure the backend wallet, you can:
- Declare your [BACKEND_WALLET_PV_KEY](https://github.com/0xsequence-demos/sequence-sidekick/blob/e76a47d0b9ef19f23736c1e8f863ed4795b855a8/.env.example#L16) in the .env file for a local setup (not recommended for production) or don't provide it and get a random one generated for you, you can find it in the auto generated `dev.key` file.
- Use the recommended method: setting up [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) or [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/kms) KMS and adding the necessary credentials in the .env file. 

<Note>
To find out what are the required credentials for local, AWS, or GCP wallet configurations, please refer to the [env.example](https://github.com/0xsequence-demos/sequence-sidekick/blob/master/.env.example) file.
</Note>

<Note>
Make sure you choose the correct key types in AWS KMS and GCP KMS.
- AWS KMS: `ECC_NIST_P256_KEY_ALIAS`
- GCP KMS: `GCP_KEY_RING_NAME`
</Note>

Sidekick is built to integrate seamlessly with AWS and GCP KMS, allowing you to use your KMS signer. We've developed [adapters](https://github.com/orgs/0xsequence/repositories?q=kms) that make AWS/GCP KMS compatible with the ethers signer type, ensuring compatibility with the latest version.

Sequence Sidekick empowers developers with a scalable, plug-and-play backend solution for blockchain-based applications, allowing you to focus on building without backend complexities.

<Callout type="warning">
When using the Sequence Sidekick:
- `msg.sender` will be the Sequence Wallet address of your EOA, not your EOA address
- `tx.origin` will be one of the Sequence Relayer addresses
- Ensure proper permissions are granted for contract function calls to the Sequence Wallet address
- View active relayer addresses in the [mainnet status page](https://mainnet-relayer.sequence.app/status)
</Callout>

## Start Sidekick in dev mode

<Step title="Make sure you have Docker installed">

Get it from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

</Step>

<Step title="Start Sidekick in a Docker container">

```shell
pnpm docker:start
```
</Step>

<Step title="Check your backend wallet address">

```shell
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:3000/sidekick/smart-account-address'
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Dev mode without Docker
If you want to make changes to the codebase and test them without Docker
```shell
pnpm install
pnpm dev:withRedis
```
This will run Sidekick and also start a Redis server.

## Gas Sponsorship
On testnet, we sponsor all the transactions. However, on mainnet - you will want to ensure that you sponsor the transactions in order to ensure that they process correctly by sponsoring the contract itself. You can take a deeper look at our [Gas Sponsorship](/solutions/builder/gas-sponsorship) solution to learn how to do this.
