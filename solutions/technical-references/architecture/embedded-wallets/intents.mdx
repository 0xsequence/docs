"Intents" are actions that you can use to interact with your account, sessions, and wallet. This document breaks down how they work internally. Don't worry about the complexities - SDKs take care of all that.

Think of an intent as a JSON object. It represents the action you want to take and is signed with your session key. For instance, if you want to sign a message, you would send an intent to the WaaS API.

## What are they?

At a high level an intent is simply a JSON object specifying the action the user intents to perform and signed using their session key. For example, to sign a message, the client would send the following intent to the WaaS API:

```
{
    "version": "0.0.0",
    "issuedAt": 1712775116,
    "expiresAt": 1712775416,
    "name": "signMessage",
    "data": {
      "wallet": "0x7B7D7BA79542584f9AeF539F6696c070a4e1Ced6",
      "network": "1",
      "message": "0x48656c6c6f2c20686176652061206e69636520646179"
    },
    "signatures": [
      {
        "sessionId": "0x01047de46debeeb83e1270b80ae65996ea64ad2c033e330cfffe9b725bf078423140124dce0cfe0cab9a61b385ca74fe77cd5e8a7147bfd87052f334cfbadc45c79a",
        "signature": "0x28ec6ddcdbc0987a99dde19792ff0c9be69ad2be873fb9351353171b74d2df3380f0ffcae2b8cb37a0659e374859420500b4399a2aab0209ee7919aaea575ac7"
      }
    ]
}
```

Let's break down the structure of an intent.

- **Signatures:** Usually, a single signature represents your session. A session is a key pair created locally; the public key is part of the `sessionId` and the private key stays on your device. Make sure to store your session key, which provides access to your wallet, securely, ideally in a secure on-device enclave. Before you can use the session, you need to register it with the WaaS API.
- The signature is an EIP-191 of the intent's canonical representation. This means itâ€™s a JSON of alphabetically ordered keys, with no whitespace, excluding the `signatures` field.
- **Name and Data:** The name and data will change with each intent. The name identifies the type of intent and the data associated with it.
- **Timestamps:** The API checks the unix timestamps to determine the validity period of the intent and to prevent old intents from being reused in the future.
