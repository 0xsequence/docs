The Sequence Marketplace provides game builders with a boilerplate marketplace that comes with a solid foundation, allowing users to buy, list, make offers, and accept offers from the start.

<Tip>

The officially maintained contract address is `0xfdb42A198a932C8D3B506Ffa5e855bC4b348a712`, and is available with the same address on all networks supported by the sequence stack.
