sidebarTitle: Custom Marketplace
---

Sequence Marketplace provides developers with a boilerplate marketplace that comes with a solid foundation, allowing users to buy, list, make offers, and accept offers from the start. Alternatively, you can use our Marketplace SDK to integrate into your existing application, or directly use our Marketplace APIs to build your own custom marketplace.
