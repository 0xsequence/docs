  <Card title="No-Code Hosted Marketplace" href="/solutions/payments/marketplace/hosted">
    Launch a white-label marketplace from Builder with no code. Configure fees, royalties (ERC-2981), collections, and theming; then publish.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom Marketplace (Boilerplate)" href="/solutions/payments/marketplace/custom">
    Start from a production-ready boilerplate. Keep full control of routes, UI, and business logic while using Sequence contracts and services.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Marketplace SDK" href="/sdk/marketplace-sdk/overview">
    Integrate marketplace actions (list, buy, offers/bids, cancel, accept) directly into your app. Build custom flows without maintaining a full marketplace UI.

## When to use what

- **Prototype or go live immediately** without engineering bandwidth → use the <a href="/solutions/payments/marketplace/hosted">No-Code Hosted Marketplace</a>.
- **You want control over UX and business rules** but don’t want to build everything from scratch → use the <a href="/solutions/payments/marketplace/custom">Custom Marketplace (Boilerplate)</a>.
- **You already have an app and only need marketplace actions** (e.g., list/buy in your existing UI) → use the <a href="/sdk/marketplace-sdk/overview">Marketplace SDK</a>.
- **You need search/browse at scale with external liquidity** → use the <a href="/api-references/marketplace/overview">Marketplace APIs (Aggregated Listings)</a>.

<Info>
Aggregation currently targets <strong>major EVM chains</strong> and normalizes results across sources. Coverage varies by chain and marketplace; see the API reference for exact fields and filters.
