<Note>
This page is a high‑level intro. For full docs, see the <a href="https://docs.trails.build/home">Trails documentation</a> and <a href="https://trails.build/">site</a>.
</Note>

## What you get

- **One confirmation** from any EOA or smart wallet (embedded or external).
- **Unified liquidity**: check balances across chains/tokens; propose viable routes.
- **Automatic orchestration**: swap/bridge as needed, then execute the final target call on the destination chain.
- **Non‑custodial**: users sign; Trails never holds funds.

## Typical uses

- **Pay**: mints, purchases, subscriptions, in‑app currency top‑ups.  
- **Fund**: deposits to protocols, on‑chain account funding.  
- **Swap**: low‑latency cross‑chain swaps in‑app.  
- **Earn**: deposit into vaults/strategies.

## How it works (high level)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define intent">
    Your app declares the destination chain, target contract/call, and desired amount/currency.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Inspect & route">
    Trails inspects the user’s balances. If passthrough is possible, it uses it; otherwise it proposes cross‑chain/token routes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Orchestrate & execute">
    Trails bundles required swaps/bridges and submits the final transaction for the user to confirm — one signature.
  </Step>
</Steps>
