## What is Trails?

Trails is a cross-chain payment orchestration system that simplifies complex blockchain transactions for your users. Instead of requiring users to manually bridge tokens, swap currencies, and execute transactions across multiple chains, Trails handles all the complexity behind the scenes with just one user confirmation.

**The problem:** Users often have funds scattered across different blockchains and tokens, making it difficult to pay for services or interact with dApps that require specific tokens on specific chains.

**The solution:** Trails automatically finds the best route to fulfill payment intents by checking user balances across chains, orchestrating necessary swaps and bridges, and executing the final transaction—all with a single signature from the user.

## What you get

- **One confirmation** from any EOA or smart wallet (embedded or external).
- **Unified liquidity**: check balances across chains/tokens; propose viable routes.
- **Automatic orchestration**: swap/bridge as needed, then execute the final target call on the destination chain.
- **Non‑custodial**: users sign; Trails never holds funds.

## Typical uses

- **Pay**: mints, purchases, subscriptions, in‑app currency top‑ups.  
- **Fund**: deposits to protocols, on‑chain account funding.  
- **Swap**: low‑latency cross‑chain swaps in‑app.  
- **Earn**: deposit into vaults/strategies.

## How it works (high level)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define intent">
    Your app declares the destination chain, target contract/call, and desired amount/currency.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Inspect & route">
    Trails inspects the user’s balances. If passthrough is possible, it uses it; otherwise it proposes cross‑chain/token routes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Orchestrate & execute">
    Trails bundles required swaps/bridges and submits the final transaction for the user to confirm — one signature.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Get started

- **Install:** `pnpm add 0xtrails`  
- **Docs & examples:** <a href="https://docs.trails.build/home">docs.trails.build/home</a>
