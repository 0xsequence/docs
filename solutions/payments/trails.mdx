Trails enables cross-chain payments with a single user confirmation. It automatically handles token swaps and blockchain bridges, making it easy for users to pay with any token on any supported chain.

For complete documentation, visit [docs.trails.build](https://docs.trails.build/home).

## Key benefits

- **Single confirmation**: Users only need to sign once, regardless of complexity
- **Cross-chain support**: Use tokens from any supported blockchain
- **Automatic routing**: Trails finds the best path for swaps and bridges
- **Non-custodial**: Users maintain control of their funds

## Common use cases

- **Payments**: NFT mints, purchases, subscriptions
- **Funding**: Protocol deposits, account top-ups
- **Swaps**: Cross-chain token exchanges
- **DeFi**: Vault deposits and yield strategies

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set your intent">
    Define what you want to pay for and which blockchain it's on.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the route">
    Trails inspects the user’s balances. If passthrough is possible, it uses it; otherwise it proposes cross‑chain/token routes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Orchestrate & execute">
    Trails bundles required swaps/bridges and submits the final transaction for the user to confirm — one signature.
  </Step>
</Steps>
