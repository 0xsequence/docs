**Indexer** gives you low-latency reads across EVM chains: balances and portfolio, token and NFT ownership, transfers and logs, prices, and contract events. It is built for production: cursor-based pagination, filters, webhooks, and event subscriptions. All in a scalable, 99.99% uptime service.

## What you can build

- **Wallet and portfolio views**: unified balances and positions across chains.
- **Activity feeds**: transfers, mints, burns, sales.
- **Collection browsers**: NFTs with metadata and ownership.
- **Analytics**: prices, volumes, holders, and contract events.

## Quickstart

Use the SDKs for the fastest path, or call the REST API directly. The examples below illustrate typical requests; see the API reference for exact parameters and response fields.

<CodeGroup>

```shell Curl
curl -X POST https://polygon-indexer.sequence.app/rpc/Indexer/GetTokenBalances \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -H "X-Access-Key: AQAAAAAAAF_JvPALhBthL7VGn6jV0YDqaFY" \
 -d '{ "accountAddress": "0x8e3E38fe7367dd3b52D1e281E4e8400447C8d8B9", "includeMetadata": true }'
```

```ts Typescript
// Make sure to install the @0xsequence/indexer package:
// npm install @0xsequence/indexer
// or
// yarn add @0xsequence/indexer

import { SequenceIndexer } from '@0xsequence/indexer'

const indexer = new SequenceIndexer('https://polygon-indexer.sequence.app', 'AQAAAAAAAF_JvPALhBthL7VGn6jV0YDqaFY')

// try any account address you'd like :)
const accountAddress = '0xabc...'

// query Sequence Indexer for all token balances of the account on Polygon
const tokenBalances = await indexer.getTokenBalances({
	accountAddress: accountAddress,
	includeMetadata: true
})
console.log('tokens in your account:', tokenBalances)
```

```go Go
import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence/indexer"
)

func GetTokenBalances(accountAddress string) {
	seqIndexer := indexer.NewIndexer("https://polygon-indexer.sequence.app", "AQAAAAAAAF_JvPALhBthL7VGn6jV0YDqaFY")

	includeMetadata := true

	tokenBalances, _, err := seqIndexer.GetTokenBalances(context.Background(), &accountAddress, nil, &includeMetadata, nil, nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("tokenBalances:", tokenBalances)
}
```
