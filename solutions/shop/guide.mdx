</Step>

<Step title="Create a New Sale">

If you choose to create a new sale, follow these steps:

1. **Enter a name** for the sale.
2. **Upload a banner image** for the sale. (Recommended size: **2440 x 960 pixels**)
3. **Select an item contract**:
    - Must be a Sequence-deployed `ERC-1155` contract
    - Must be linked to a collection with valid metadata

> **Note: If the selected collection is private or missing metadata, image previews and titles may not render correctly.**

### ERC-1155
When creating an ERC-1155 sale, you can choose between two configuration modes:

- **Sell a uniform range** — All tokens share the same default settings and draw from a single pool, unless you override settings for specific tokens.
- **Sell specific items** — Select individual token IDs and assign unique settings to each one.

#### Sell a uniform range
_All tokens share the same default settings and draw from a single pool, unless you override settings for specific tokens._

**Default sale settings (apply to the whole pool):**
- **Start time** (UTC) — When minting/purchase opens.
- **End time** (UTC) — When minting/purchase closes.
- **Default item price** — Used for any token in the range that doesn’t have an explicit override.
- **Default currency** — Payment token (e.g., sETH).

**Token range settings:**
- **Min token ID** — First token ID included in the pool.
- **Max token ID** — Last token ID included in the pool (inclusive).
- **Remaining supply** — Total mints still allowed across the contract/pool. Must be greater than 0. This value is **dynamic** and will decrease automatically as sales are triggered, reflecting the live remaining number of mints available.

**Custom token settings (optional):**
Add overrides for individual token IDs inside the range (e.g., different price, supply or timing).

#### Sell specific items
_Select individual token IDs and assign unique settings to each one._

**Sale settings:**
- **Default currency** — Payment token for this sale (e.g., sETH).

**Token configuration:**
1. Click **Add items** and enter one or more token IDs.
2. For each item, set its price, supply, start/end time (if different from any default timing you want), and other available options.
3. Save the list.

</Step>

<Step title="Previewing and Testing the Shop">

To preview the Shop before making it public:

1. From the Shop section in Builder, click **View Marketplace**.
2. Sign in with your configured wallet.
3. Refresh the page to trigger **private mode** preview.

When private mode is active, a notification banner will appear at the top of the page indicating you are in preview mode.
