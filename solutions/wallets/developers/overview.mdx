## Embedded Wallets

You might want to continue leveraging our Embedded Wallet product for the time being if:

- You have a production integration that relies on the Embedded Wallet architecture.
- You need a short-term prototype while your Ecosystem Wallet is being set up.
- See [Embedded Wallet docs](/solutions/wallets/developers/embedded-wallets) and plan a medium-term migration to Ecosystem Wallet.

## Next steps

- Start with the [Ecosystem Wallet quickstart](/solutions/wallets/developers/ecosystem-wallet/quickstart).  
- If you operate a chain or plan an ecosystem-wide wallet, go to [For Ecosystems](/solutions/wallets/ecosystems/overview).
