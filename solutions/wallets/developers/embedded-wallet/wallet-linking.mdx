# Wallet Linking Overview

Wallet Linking enables the ability for a developer to create a verifiable association between two wallets from a single user. Generally, this is a link between an embedded wallet for a game or application and an external wallet, such as Metamask. This solves a number of issues for games such as:

- Validating a user holds an NFT, but doesn't want to move their valuable asset around for token-gating or reward distributions.
- Easy migration for flow of funds or liquidity from an external wallet to the embedded wallet for a game.
- Verifiying a number of ERC20 tokens a user holds to provide governance rights.

Using Sequence SDKs, the embedded wallet session can be instantiated from nearly any platform such as Mobile, Web, PC or Console so users can enjoy a seamless game experience. However, when desired, a user is directed to an external browser session to link additional wallets.

# Integrating Wallet Linking

Time to complete: 25-35 minutes

In this guide, we will showcase how to sign into an [Embedded Wallet](/solutions/wallets/developers/embedded-wallet/overview) using traditional authentication like email or social login. Then, in order to link an external wallet address using Web SDK (now Web SDK) to your Embedded Wallet, we will sign a message which creates a queryable set of addresses for a single user profile stored off-chain privately. Finally, other features of the API will be delved into, like listing total wallets linked and removal of the state of linked wallets, both using signatures for privacy preserving means.

# Demo 
Give a [try of an example demo](https://demo-waas-wallet-link.pages.dev/) or [view the full source code](https://github.com/0xsequence-demos/demo-embedded-wallet-linking).

# Quickstart 

Try a quickstart application with a CLI command in your terminal to run locally:

### Clone the repo
```shell
git clone https://github.com/0xsequence-demos/demo-embedded-wallet-linking.git && cd ./demo-embedded-wallet-linking
```

# Using the Wallet Linking API

## 1. Integrating the API Interface File

In order to begin using the API, an interface file is integrated into the cloned application so the Sequence API can be called upon conveniently.

The [source code for the interface can be found here](https://github.com/0xsequence-demos/demo-embedded-wallet-linking/blob/master/src/api/api.gen.ts) which then is instantiated with the existing Sequence server like such:

```typescript
import { 
    API,            // API interface
    LinkedWallet    // typed class
} from "./api.gen";

const api = new API("https://dev-api.sequence.app", fetch);
```

#### Simple examples using the API functions integrated in the repository using `0xsequence/waas` and `wagmi` packages:
1. [`linkWallet(...)`](/solutions/wallets/developers/embedded-wallet/wallet-linking#2-link-an-external-wallet-to-an-embedded-wallet)
2. [`getLinkedWallets(...)`](/solutions/wallets/developers/embedded-wallet/wallet-linking#3-retrieving-linked-wallets)
3. [`removeLinkedWallet(...)`](/solutions/wallets/developers/embedded-wallet/wallet-linking#4-removing-linked-wallets)

## 2. Link an external wallet to an embedded wallet

In order to link an external wallet (e.g. EOA, Sequence Universal Wallet, etc.) to an Embedded Wallet, we first need to authenticate the user with an embedded wallet which is categorized as the `parent` wallet. Once authenticated, we would then authenticate them again using Web SDK where the user signs a message after authentication to validate ownership of that wallet. That message will be passed to the `linkWallet` API endpoint, with the following typed arguments and return types (negating the optional values):
 
```typescript
interface LinkWalletArgs {
  parentWalletAddress: string // Address of the Embedded Wallet
  parentWalletMessage: string // Message from the Embedded Wallet
  parentWalletSignature: string // Signature from Embedded Wallet
  linkedWalletAddress: string // External wallet address you want to link
  linkedWalletMessage: string // Message from the external wallet
  linkedWalletSignature: string // Signature from the external wallet
  signatureChainId: string // ChainId which you want to verify, using 137 in the example.
  linkedWalletType?: string // Optional value to identify what type of wallet is being connected, i.e., 'sequence'
}

interface LinkWalletReturn {
  status: boolean
}

linkWallet(args: LinkWalletArgs, headers?: object, signal?: AbortSignal): Promise<LinkWalletReturn>
```

### Sign Message to Attest to Owning an Address

There are two signatures required: one for the Embedded Wallet signing the Web SDK wallet address (linked wallet), and the linked wallet (from Web SDK) signing the parent wallet address (Embedded Wallet). You can sign any message presented to the user, as long as the message and signature are consistent with what is passed to the API later. For example, using the following code in React with Wagmi to obtain this information using Sequence:

```typescript
import {
  ...
  useSignMessage,
  useAccount,
  ...
} from "wagmi";

function App() {

    const { signMessageAsync } = useSignMessage();
    const { address: kitWalletAddress } = useAccount();
    
    const getSignaturesForLinking = async () => {
        const parentWalletMessage = "linked wallet with address "
        const linkedWalletMessage = "parent wallet with address "
        const parentMessage = parentWalletMessage + kitWalletAddress
        const parentWalletAddress = await sequenceWaas.getAddress()
        const linkingMessage = "Link to " + linkedWalletMessage + parentWalletAddress

        const response: any = await signMessageAsync({
            message: linkingMessage,
        })

        const parentSignatureRes = await sequenceWaas.signMessage({
            message: parentMessage
        })

        const parentSignature = parentSignatureRes.data.signature
        const linkedSignature = response
        const linkedWalletAddress = kitWalletAddress

        return { parentWalletAddress, linkedWalletAddress, parentMessage, linkingMessage, parentSignature, linkedSignature }
    }
}
```

### Use API to Add Signature Payload & Parent Wallet Address
Call the previous `getSignaturesForLinking` function and unpack the response to pass the responses into the `api.linkWallet` function:

```typescript
function App(){
    const connections = useConnections();
    ...
    const linkWallet = async () => {
        const signaturesResult = await getSignaturesForLinking()
        const { parentWalletAddress, linkedWalletAddress, parentMessage, linkingMessage, parentSignature, linkedSignature } = signaturesResult
        const connectorName = connections[0]?.connector.name;

        const response = await api.linkWallet({
            signatureChainId: "137", // network chosen for both embedded wallet and Web SDK
            linkedWalletType: connectorName,
            parentWalletAddress,
            parentWalletMessage: parentMessage,
            parentWalletSignature: parentSignature,
            linkedWalletAddress: linkedWalletAddress!,
            linkedWalletMessage: linkingMessage,
            linkedWalletSignature: linkedSignature,
        })

        console.log(`status: ${response.status}`)
    }
}
```

## 3. Retrieving Linked Wallets

To protect the privacy of users, you can pass in a signature generated from the parent Embedded Wallet in order to retrieve the list of wallet addresses that is linked to a parent wallet address.

The API will return the linked wallet objects in the following format:

```typescript
interface LinkedWallet {
  id: number
  walletType?: string
  walletAddress: string
  linkedWalletAddress: string
  createdAt?: string
}

interface GetLinkedWalletsReturn {
  linkedWallets: Array<LinkedWallet>
}
```

And this can be accomplished in the following way, by passing in a message, getting a signature from the parent Embedded Wallet, checking to see the signature is readable, then passing the variables: `parentWalletAddress`,`parentWalletMessage`,`parentWalletSignature` and `signatureChainId` to the API:

```typescript
const getLinkedWallets = async () => {
    const parentWalletAddress = await sequenceWaas.getAddress()
    const message = "parent wallet with address " + parentWalletAddress
    const signature = await sequenceWaas.signMessage({
        message: message,
    })

    if (!signature.data.signature) {
        console.error("Could not get signature from wallet to be linked")
        throw new Error("Could not get signature from wallet to be linked")
    }

    const response = await api.getLinkedWallets({
        parentWalletAddress: parentWalletAddress as `0x${string}`,
        parentWalletMessage: message,
        parentWalletSignature: signature.data.signature,
        signatureChainId: "137",
    })

    response.linkedWallets.map((linkedWallet: LinkedWallet) => console.log(linkedWallet))

    return response.linkedWallets
}
```

## 4. Removing Linked Wallets
Finally, if you no longer want to keep a wallet linked off-chain to a parent wallet, you can perform a signature by both wallet instances (Embedded Wallet & Web SDK linked wallet), and pass in the linked wallet address, [like in step 6](/solutions/wallets/developers/embedded-wallet/wallet-linking#2-link-an-external-wallet-to-an-embedded-wallet) in order to remove the linked state:

### Sign Message to Attest to Removing a Linked Address

```typescript
import {
  ...
  useAccount,
  useSignMessage
  ...
} from "wagmi";

function App() {

    const { address: kitWalletAddress } = useAccount();
    const { signMessageAsync } = useSignMessage();

    const getSignaturesForUnlinking = async () => {
        const parentWalletMessage = "linked wallet with address "
        const linkedWalletMessage = "parent wallet with address "
        const parentWalletAddress = await sequenceWaas.getAddress()
        const linkingMessage = "Unlink from " + linkedWalletMessage + parentWalletAddress

        const response: any = await signMessageAsync({
            message: linkingMessage,
        })

        const parentSignatureRes = await sequenceWaas.signMessage({
            message: parentMessage
        })

        const parentSignature = parentSignatureRes.data.signature
        const linkedSignature = response
        const linkedWalletAddress = kitWalletAddress

        return { parentWalletAddress, linkedWalletAddress, parentMessage, linkingMessage, parentSignature, linkedSignature }
    }
}
```

### Use API to Add Signature Payload for Parent Address
```typescript
function App(){
    ...
    const unLinkWallet = async () => {
        const signaturesResult = await getSignaturesForUnlinking()
        const { parentWalletAddress, linkedWalletAddress, parentMessage, linkingMessage, parentSignature, linkedSignature } = signaturesResult;

        const response = await api.removeLinkedWallet({
            signatureChainId: "137", // network chosen for both Embedded Wallet and Web SDK
            parentWalletAddress,
            parentWalletMessage: parentMessage,
            parentWalletSignature: parentSignature,
            linkedWalletAddress: linkedWalletAddress!,
            linkedWalletMessage: linkingMessage,
            linkedWalletSignature: linkedSignature,
        });

        console.log(`status: ${response.status}`)
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

We've provided a sample application that allows you to authenticate a user with your embedded wallet configuration, validate a message from an external wallet, and then link these together using the Sequence Linking API. Furthermore, we went over how to use these API functions using simple examples from React & Wagmi. You can either use the standalone application we've provided or leverage the same flow in your own application from here.
