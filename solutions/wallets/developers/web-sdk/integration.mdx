Adding a Sequence-powered smart wallet to your React dApp is a straightforward process. This guide outlines the three core steps to get you from a new project to a fully integrated wallet.

## ðŸ”‘ Step 1: Get Your Project Access Key

First, you need a key to connect your dApp to the Sequence infrastructure. This key identifies your project and enables our services.

**Action:** Go to [sequence.build](https://sequence.build), sign up or log in, and create a new project.

**Result:** You will be able to get your unique `projectAccessKey`.

## ðŸ“¦ Step 2: Install the core SDK package `@0xsequence/connect`

Next, add the primary Sequence Web SDK package to your project's dependencies. This package contains all the necessary hooks, components, and the pre-built wallet modal.

**Action:** In your project's terminal, run the installation command:

```bash
npm install @0xsequence/connect
```

**Result:** The Sequence SDK is now a dependency in your project, ready to be used.

## ðŸ”— Step 3: Integrate with Your React App

Finally, wrap your application with our wallet provider. This makes all connect features available to any component within your dApp.

**Action:** Follow our official [Web SDK Integration Guide](/sdk/web/getting-started) for an in-depth guide on how to integrate.

**Result:** The Sequence wallet is now live in your dApp. You can immediately use wagmi hooks like `useConnect()` to allow users to sign in with their socials or email and interact with the blockchain.
