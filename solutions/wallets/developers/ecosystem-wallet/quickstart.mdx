To see a fully integrated demo, check out [Mining Quest](https://mining-quest-v3.pages.dev/). You can also see its [source code here](https://github.com/0xsequence-demos/mining-quest/tree/v3).

## ðŸ”‘ Step 1: Get Your Project Access Key

First, you need a key to connect your dApp to the Sequence infrastructure. This key identifies your project and enables our services.

Go to [sequence.build](https://sequence.build), sign up or log in, and create a new project. You can follow the [Builder Getting Started](/solutions/builder/getting-started) guide to get a step by step flow.

You will now be able to get your unique `projectAccessKey`.

## ðŸ“¦ Step 2: Install the core SDK package `@0xsequence/connect`

Next, add the primary Sequence Web SDK package to your project's dependencies. This package contains all the necessary hooks, components, and the pre-built wallet modal.

In your project's terminal, run the installation command:

```bash
pnpm install @0xsequence/connect
```

The Sequence SDK is now a dependency in your project, ready to be used.

## ðŸ”— Step 3: Integrate with Your React App

Finally, wrap your application with our wallet provider. This makes all connect features available to any component within your dApp:

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "@0xsequence/design-system";
import { SequenceConnect, createConfig } from "@0xsequence/connect";

import { Homepage } from "./components/Homepage";

const config = createConfig({
  projectAccessKey: "YOUR_PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY",
  defaultTheme: "dark",
  signIn: {
    projectName: "My Dapp",
  },
  displayedAssets: [],
  readOnlyNetworks: [],
  walletUrl: "https://v3.sequence-dev.app",
  dappOrigin: window.location.origin,
  appName: "My Dapp",
  chainIds: [137],
  defaultChainId: 137,
});

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme="dark">
      <SequenceConnect config={config}>
        <SequenceWalletProvider>
          <Homepage />
        </SequenceWalletProvider>
      </SequenceConnect>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

Sequence wallet is now live in your dApp. You can immediately use wagmi hooks like `useConnect()` to allow users to sign in with their socials or email and interact with the blockchain.

As a next step, you can configure your session permissions to eliminate repeated wallet pop-ups for your users. See [Session Permissions](/solutions/wallets/developers/ecosystem-wallet/permissions) for more information.
