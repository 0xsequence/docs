## üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Install Sequence's Unity SDK

Download [v5 from the SDK's GitHub Releases](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unity/releases/tag/v5-beta)
to access Ecosystem Wallets. You can download it as a `.unitypackage` file and simply add it to your Unity project.

To see Ecosystem Wallets in action, [try our Built-In Demo.](/sdk/unity/ecosystem-wallet/setup#try-our-built-in-demo)

## üîë Step 2: Configure your Unity Project

Go to [sequence.build](https://sequence.build), sign up or log in, and create a new project. You can follow the [Builder Getting Started](/solutions/builder/getting-started) guide to get a step by step flow.

Follow our [Unity Setup](/sdk/unity/ecosystem-wallet/setup) to configure the Unity SDK.

## üíº Step 3: Create a Session with Permissions

To send a transaction to a specific contract, you must first create a session with the required permissions.

```csharp
Chain chain = Chain.TestnetAbitrumSepolia;
Address contractAddress = new Address("0x33985d320809E26274a72E03268c8a29927Bc6dA");
BigInteger deadline = new BigInteger(DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.ToUnixTimeSeconds() * 1000 + 1000 * 60 * 5000);
BigInteger valueLimit = 0;

IPermissions permissions = new ContractPermissions(chain, contractAddress, deadline, valueLimit);
```

Next, let‚Äôs create the `SequenceConnect` interface with these permissions to create a wallet session.
Checkout other [login options here.](/sdk/unity/ecosystem-wallet/setup#try-our-built-in-demo)

```csharp
SequenceConnect connect = new SequenceConnect();
IWallet wallet = await connect.SignInWithGoogle(permissions);
```

## üì® Step 4: Send Transactions

Finally, let‚Äôs use our wallet session to send a transaction to the contract address specified in our permissions.

```csharp
Chain chain = Chain.TestnetAbitrumSepolia;
Address to = new Address("0x33985d320809E26274a72E03268c8a29927Bc6dA");

ITransaction[] transactions = new Transaction[]
{
    new Transaction(to, 0, "explicitEmit()")
};

string txnHash = await wallet.SendTransaction(chain, transactions);
```
