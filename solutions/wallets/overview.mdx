Sequence Wallets are a suite of non-custodial smart wallet solutions that make it easy to onboard users and scale Web3 apps, games, and ecosystems. Powered by account abstraction and enterprise-grade security, Sequence removes wallet fragmentation, gas complexity, and onboarding friction so you can focus on building.

## We offer two main wallet services:

[For Ecosystems](/solutions/wallets/ecosystems) â†’ One wallet that unifies your entire ecosystem.

[For Developers](/solutions/wallets/developers) â†’ Powerful SDKs and infrastructure to integrate wallets anywhere.

Both services are fully non-custodial, cross-chain, and designed to give your users the best Web3 experience.
