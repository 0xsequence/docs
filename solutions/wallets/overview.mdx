Sequence is the best way to onboard players to your blockchain-enabled game. We have two main options to get started: the [Embedded Wallet](/sdk/headless-wallet/quickstart) and the [Ecosystem Wallet](/solutions/wallets/ecosystem/overview). Both are completely non-custodial.

The [Embedded Wallet](/sdk/headless-wallet/quickstart) is designed for a traditional gaming experience. The advantages are:
- Authenticate users with common social providers or email.
- Support for Unity, Unreal, Web, and Mobile.
- Optional pop-ups, modals, and transaction signing for a seamless UX.
- Fully non-custodial, smart contract wallet.
- Out of the box login with [Sequence Kit](/sdk/web/overview) or build your own flow.

On the other hand, the [Ecosystem Wallet](/solutions/wallets/ecosystem/overview) caters to chains and apps who want to build an entire ecosystem.

Our [Web SDK](/sdk/web/overview) library is a customizable UI written in Typescript, tailored for a browser experience. This is great when you want to support users with existing wallets like Metamask, have an out-of-the-box experience, as well as millions of potential new users who prefer the convenience of social login.

Lastly, we provide [Wallet Linking](/sdk/web/getting-started) for your ecosystem which enables the ability for a developer to create a verifiable association between two wallets from a single user. Generally, this is a link between an embedded wallet for a game or application and an external wallet, such as Metamask so you can easily query all wallets associated with a single user - across games, ecosystems, and blockchains.

## Getting Started
Start your integration with Sequence at our quickstart for [Embedded Wallets](/sdk/headless-wallet/quickstart) in just a few minutes.
