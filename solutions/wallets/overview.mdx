## Why Sequence Ecosystem Wallet

- **One address per user across apps and chains** â€” consistent identity and asset view.
- **Smart Sessions** isolate permissions per app for maximum security and fewer signatures. See [Smart Sessions](/solutions/wallets/ecosystems/smart-sessions).
- **Seamless onboarding** with email, socials, passkeys, or external wallets.
- **Cross-chain by default** with built-in swaps, on-ramps, and portfolio views.
- **Developer-first SDKs** for Web, Mobile, Unity, and Unreal.
- **Enterprise-grade security**: hardware-isolated signers, TEEs (AWS Nitro Enclaves), and public attestations.

## For Ecosystems

- **One wallet that works everywhere** on your domain and brand.
- **Eliminate fragmentation**: a single address and inventory across your ecosystem, with sandboxed Smart Sessions protecting users and protocols.
- **Branded wallet UX**: hosted by Sequence on your domain, or fully custom with the Wallet Development Kit.
- **Fast developer adoption**: app teams integrate in minutes with Web, Mobile, Unity, and Unreal SDKs.
- **Curated discovery**: wallet surfaces ecosystem apps and assets.
- **Security by design**: isolated signing keys, hardware-backed AWS Nitro Enclaves, public attestations (e.g., Quantstamp, CoinCover).
