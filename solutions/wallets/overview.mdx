## Why Sequence Ecosystem Wallet

- **One address per user across apps and chains** â€” consistent identity and no more token fragmentation.

- **Seamless onboarding** with email, social auth, passkeys, or external wallets.
- **Cross-chain by default** with built-in swaps, on-ramps, and combined portfolio views.
- **Developer-first SDKs** for Web, Mobile, Unity, and Unreal.
- **Enterprise-grade security**: hardware-isolated signers (TEEs), and public attestations for every deployment.
