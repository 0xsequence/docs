description: Launch an Ecosystem Wallet on your domain with Sequence-operated infrastructure, branding control, Smart Sessions, and passkey-based auth.
sidebarTitle: Hosted Wallet

The **Hosted Wallet** is the fastest way to launch an Ecosystem Wallet on your domain. Sequence operates the wallet infrastructure while you control branding, configuration, and policies in Builder. Your developers then integrate against a stable, attested wallet surface across all your apps.

## What you get

- **Your domain and brand**: run at `wallet.yourdomain.com` with your theme, logo, and copy.
- **Smart Sessions**: scoped, sandboxed permissions per app to reduce signing spam and protect users.
- **Passkeys and familiar logins**: support for passkeys plus email/social logins; external wallets can be linked.
- **Attested identity**: sessions are signed by an enclave-based Identity Instrument; apps never handle social auth keys.
- **Cross-chain by default**: multi-chain accounts, balances, and transactions.
- **Admin in Builder**: configure chains, branding, session policies, and integrations from an ecosystem admin panel.
- **Production ops**: Sequence runs the wallet stack, Identity Instrument, monitoring, and updates.

Smart Sessions are central to ecosystem safety and UX. Learn more in [Smart Sessions](/solutions/wallets/ecosystems/smart-sessions).

## How it works (high level)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your ecosystem">
    In Builder, set your wallet domain, branding, supported chains, and initial policies.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up identity and auth">
    Enable passkeys and connect your identity providers. Session attestations are issued by the enclave-based Identity Instrument.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define session policies">
    Create Smart Session scopes for your apps (methods, limits, timeouts), and register app origins.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch">
    Sequence provisions and operates the wallet on your domain. Your developers connect apps using the standard integration flow.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security and reliability

- **Non-custodial**: users control their keys; timed recovery keys can be enabled.
- **Hardware isolation**: critical signing and identity attestations use TEEs (AWS Nitro Enclaves).
- **Checkpointer**: only the latest wallet configuration is accepted on-chain; supports safe key rotation.
- **Audited architecture**: see [Technical References](/solutions/technical-references/overview) for contracts, audits, and deployments.

## Who it is for

Chains and ecosystems that want a branded wallet, fast time to market, and managed operations without building a wallet from scratch.
