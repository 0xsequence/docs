## Why ecosystems adopt this solution

- **One wallet across all your apps** on your domain and branded for your ecosystem.
- **Smart Sessions** remove security risks by sandboxing permissions for each app. See [Smart Sessions](/solutions/wallets/ecosystems/smart-sessions).
- **Passkeys** provide strong, phishing-resistant auth without seed phrases.
- **Timed recovery keys** provide private passphrase support with time-based recovery for best-in-class security. See [Timed Recovery](/solutions/wallets/ecosystems/timed-recovery).
- **Attested identity** using a TEE service that signs session attestations and keeps social auth secrets out of reach from any app. See [Identity Instrument](/solutions/wallets/ecosystems/identity-instrument).
- **Ecosystem Admin** in Builder to configure chains, branding, session policies, and integrations.

## Architecture basics

- **Smart Sessions**: scoped permissions that enable apps to execute under sandboxed rules. See [Smart Sessions](/solutions/wallets/ecosystems/smart-sessions).
- **Identity Instrument**: a Nitro-enclave service that validates IdP logins and signs session attestations. Your apps never handle raw IdP client secrets. See [Identity Instrument](/solutions/wallets/ecosystems/identity-instrument).
- **Merkleized wallet configuration**: a single on-chain root covers signers, sessions, recovery, and extensions. See [Wallet Configuration](/solutions/wallets/ecosystems/wallet-config).
- **Guard Firewall**: reviews every transaction for malicious activity, and enforces ecosystem-level blacklists and policies. See [Guard Firewall](/solutions/wallets/ecosystems/guard-firewall).
