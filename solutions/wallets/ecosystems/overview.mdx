title: "Wallets for Ecosystems"
description: Ecosystem Wallet is a user-first smart wallet that runs on your domain and serves all your dapps. It combines passkeys, Smart Sessions, and a merkleized wallet configuration to deliver higher security with less friction.
sidebarTitle: Overview

## Why ecosystems adopt this solution

- **One wallet across all your apps** on your domain and branded for your ecosystem.
- **Smart Sessions** remove security risks by sandboxing permissions for each dapp.
- **Passkeys** provide strong, phishing-resistant auth without seed phrases.
- **Timed recovery keys** provide private passphrase support with time-based recovery for best-in-class security.
- **Attested identity** using a Nitro-enclave service that signs session attestations and keeps IdP secrets out of reach from any dapp.

## Architecture basics

- **Smart Sessions**: scoped permissions that enable dapps to execute under sandboxed rules. See [Smart Sessions](/solutions/wallets/ecosystems/smart-sessions).
- **Identity Instrument**: a Nitro-enclave service that validates IdP logins and signs session attestations. Your apps never handle raw IdP client secrets.  
- **Merkleized wallet configuration**: a single on-chain root covers signers, sessions, recovery, and extensions.  
- **Checkpointer**: ensures only the latest wallet configuration is accepted on-chain, enabling safe key rotation and cross-chain coherence.
