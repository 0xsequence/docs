description: Build a fully custom Ecosystem Wallet using the Wallet Development Kit on top of Sequence infrastructure. Self-host critical components if needed.
sidebarTitle: Custom Wallet
---

The **Wallet Development Kit (WDK)** lets you build a custom Ecosystem Wallet while using Sequence infrastructure for identity, sessions, transactions, and data. You own the UI, routing, and product decisions, and you can self-host critical components where required.

- Package: `@0xsequence/wallet-wdk`
- Repo: [sequence.js](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence.js)

## What you build vs what we provide

| Area | You build | Sequence provides |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UI/UX | Wallet screens, flows, routing, theming | Reference components and SDKs |
| Auth and sessions | Choose login UX, wire flows | Identity Instrument (session attestations), Smart Sessions model |
| Transactions | App-specific flows and UX | [Transaction API](/solutions/infrastructure/transaction-api) for relaying and sponsorship |
| Data | Custom views and analytics | [Indexer](/solutions/indexer/overview) for balances, NFTs, events, prices |
| Node access | Optional custom providers | [Blockchain RPC](/solutions/infrastructure/blockchain-rpc) via Node Gateway |
| Backend | Optional business logic | [Sidekick](/solutions/infrastructure/sidekick) for secure server-side endpoints |

## Available capabilities

- **Smart Sessions** and session attestations for scoped, low-friction execution.
- **Passkeys and social logins** with enclave-signed sessions.
- **Cross-chain accounts** with a single on-chain configuration root (signers, sessions, recovery).
- **Timed recovery keys** for private passphrase support with time-based recovery.
- **Developer integrations**: Web, React Native, Unity, and Unreal via existing SDKs.
- **Services**: Indexer for reads, Transaction API for writes, Node Gateway RPC for raw calls.

## High-level integration flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install and plan hosting">
    Add the package: <code>pnpm add @0xsequence/wallet-wdk</code>. Decide which components you will self-host (e.g., UI, Identity Instrument) versus use hosted.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure ecosystem metadata">
    Set the wallet domain, supported chains, branding, and session policies. Use Builder for environment, keys, and policy management.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wire identity and sessions">
    Use the Identity Instrument for session attestations. Implement the login and session callback flow, and store session keys securely.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect services">
    Read with [Indexer](/solutions/indexer/overview), write with [Transaction API](/solutions/infrastructure/transaction-api), and access nodes with [Blockchain RPC](/solutions/infrastructure/blockchain-rpc).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test and ship">
    Validate Smart Session scopes, recovery paths, and cross-chain actions. Roll out on your domain.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Notes on self-hosting

- **Identity Instrument** can be self-hosted in your own AWS Nitro Enclave environment if your compliance model requires it.
- You can run your own **Sidekick** for controlled server-side writes and key custody.
- Contracts, audits, and deployments are documented in [Technical References](/solutions/technical-references/overview).
