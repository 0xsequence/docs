title: Smart Sessions
description: Sequence's Smart Sessions provide a seamless way to interact with dApps by reducing wallet pop-ups and improving user experience.

## The Problem with Web3 UX Today

In Web3 today, the user experience is often interrupted. Every swap, every listing, every minor action requires a wallet pop-up, forcing you to "sign" and approve. This creates friction and makes dApps feel clunky compared to the smooth apps we use every day.

## What Are Smart Sessions?

**Smart Sessions is a solution to this problem.**

A Smart Session is a secure, temporary, and strictly limited set of permissions that you grant to a dApp. Instead of approving every single transaction, you approve a session once, allowing the dApp to perform a range of pre-agreed actions on your behalf. This eliminates constant pop-ups and unlocks a fluid, Web2-like experience without sacrificing security or self-custody.

> üí° **Think of it this way:** It's less like handing over your master key (your main wallet signer) and more like giving an application a special-purpose keycard with very clear rules and limitations.

## Two Types of Smart Sessions

Sequence offers two distinct types of Smart Sessions, each designed for a different purpose:

- **Implicit Sessions:** For ultimate convenience within a single, trusted dApp.
- **Explicit Sessions:** For powerful, granular control over any on-chain action.

## 1. Implicit Sessions: The "In-App Convenience Pass"

An Implicit Session is the simplest and most common type of Smart Session. Its entire purpose is to make your experience inside a single dApp as smooth as possible.

### üéØ The Core Idea

When you connect to a dApp you trust, you are creating a "trust boundary" around that dApp's website domain. An Implicit Session gives that dApp a pass to operate freely only within its own walls.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Connect & Trust:** You connect your wallet to a dApp (e.g., `app.my-defi-protocol.com`)
2. **Silent Approval:** A session is automatically and silently created that is cryptographically locked to that specific domain without the user having to approve it.
3. **Seamless Experience:** You can now perform any action inside that dApp, swapping, staking, listing, without any further pop-ups. It just works.

### üîí The Security Guardrail

This session is useless anywhere else. If the dApp was malicious and tried to use this session to call a contract outside its domain (like the USDC contract), the transaction would be automatically rejected on-chain. The session is only valid for the dApp's own smart contracts.
The dApp will configure the permissions in the [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build)

### üìä Implicit Sessions at a Glance

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Best For** | Day-to-day use of a single dApp (DeFi protocols, marketplaces, games) |
| **Key Feature** | Maximum convenience. Eliminates all signing pop-ups within a trusted dApp environment |
| **Analogy** | A keycard for a specific building. It lets you move freely between all the rooms inside, but it won't open the door to the building next door |

## 2. Explicit Sessions: The "Programmable Permission Slip"

An Explicit Session is a more advanced and powerful tool. It's designed for when a dApp needs to perform very specific tasks that interact with other external protocols.

### üéØ The Core Idea

Instead of just trusting a whole dApp and its smart contracts, you are approving a precise list of rules for a temporary signer. You are building a custom permission slip that says exactly what can be done, where it can be done, how much can be spent, for how long, and for which contracts.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **The dApp Proposes a "Contract":** The dApp presents your wallet with a list of very specific permissions it needs. For example:
   - "Allow me to call the `transfer` function on the `USDC contract`."
   - "... with the `recipient` address `0x...` only"
   - "...for a `cumulative` total of no more than `100` USDC."
   - "...and this permission will `expire` in `24 hours`."

2. **You Explicitly Approve the Rules:** Your wallet displays these rules in a human-readable format. You review and approve this exact set of conditions.

3. **The dApp Executes:** The dApp can now perform those actions automatically, with 0 pop-ups.

### üîí The Security Guardrail

The power of Explicit Sessions comes from their granularity. Each rule is validated on-chain. If the dApp tries to do anything outside the approved scope, like spend 101 USDC instead of 100, or call the `approve` function instead of `transfer`, the transaction will fail.

### üìä Explicit Sessions at a Glance

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Best For** | Authorizing specific, automated, or high-value actions (e.g., automated yield harvesting, placing bids on an NFT, setting up recurring payments) or 0 pop-ups |
| **Key Feature** | Granular, programmable control. You define the exact scope of what the dApp is allowed to do |
| **Analogy** | A pre-authorized check. You write it out to a specific person (target), for an exact amount (valueLimit), and write "for deposit only" in the memo (rules). The bank will enforce all those rules |
