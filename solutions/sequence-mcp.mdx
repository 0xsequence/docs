# Setting Up Sequence MCP Server

The Sequence MCP Server allows you to leverage powerful AI agents like Claude directly in your preferred IDE. This integration enables you to get intelligent assistance with Sequence-related development tasks, from querying blockchain data to interacting with smart contracts.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Node.js installed on your system
- A supported IDE (Cursor or Claude Desktop)
- npm or yarn package manager

## Installation Steps

1. Open your terminal and run the following command:
   ```bash
   npx @mintlify/mcp@latest add sequence-0fb8d9e6
   ```

2. When prompted, select your preferred MCP Client:
   - Cursor
   - Claude Desktop

3. The installation process will automatically configure the Sequence MCP Server for your selected application.

## Using the MCP Server

Once installed, you can start using the AI assistance in your IDE. Here's how:

1. Open your IDE (Cursor or Claude Desktop)
2. Start typing your query related to Sequence development
3. The AI agent will process your request and provide relevant assistance

### Example Queries

You can ask questions like:
- "Create a script to query token balances and metadata for address 0x8e3E38fe7367dd3b52D1e281E4e8400447C8d8B9"
- "How do I integrate Sequence embedded wallets?"
- "Show me how to fetch transaction history for a wallet"

When your query is being processed, you'll see an indication like:
