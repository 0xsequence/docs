Utilize the Sequence marketplace protocols to build a marketplace that enables [Shopify-like](https://www.shopify.com/) control over custom code development with Sequence source code. 

The [codebase that you can clone](/solutions/marketplaces/orderbook/starter#quickstart-marketplace-boilerplate) from CLI and begin with immediately enables users to perform offers and listings for collectible items. Customize which network your collections are on using [this guide](/solutions/collectibles/contracts/deploy-an-item-collection) to deploy a collection using the [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build)
