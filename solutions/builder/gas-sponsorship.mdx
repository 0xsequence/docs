When a user utilizes a Sequence wallet, we offer the compatibility of sponsoring gas on any chain for your users - either at the contract or address level. This means higher conversion rates to smooth the onboarding experience for your users. By default, Sequence sponsors all gas on testnets for a smooth developer experience, however we recommend when going to Mainnet that sponsor gas for your users.

##### Why would I want to sponsor gas for my app?

Obtaining the crypto needed to cover gas fees poses a challenge for onboarding your users. Sponsoring gas on their behalf solves this problem, ultimately leading to higher conversion rates and retention.

Sponsoring gas is easy and works across all networks we support with a single balance.

## How to Enable Gas Sponsorship

<Steps>
<Step title="Create or Select Project">

To create a project, follow [this walkthrough](/solutions/builder/project-management#watch-a-project-be-created-in-the-builder)

If you have a project already, sign in and select from the listed projects.

</Step>
<Step title="Sponsor Contract Address">

First, navigate to the [gas sponsorship overview page](https://sequence.build/project/default/relayer?view=overview).

Then, either `+ Add Address` to sponsor gas for a specific wallet address.

Or, `Add Contract` to select a smart contract that you'd like to sponsor.

</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Add Payment & Configure">

Now, we are going to add a payment method via a credit card in order to fund the sponsorship. Go to the [gas sponsorship configuration](https://sequence.build/project/default/relayer?view=gas-tank) and select Setup Payment Method.

Add a payment method which will update your gas sponsorship configuration.

You can either do a one-time top off or an automated top-up based on preferred ranges so you can precisely configure how much you'd like to willing to subsidize for your users each month. Once you have selected your top-up amounts, go ahead and save your settings.

We will automatically notify you if your balance falls below $5 and you have sponsored contracts.

</Step>
<Step title="Test your Sponsorship">

We recommend testing out your sponsorships prior to launching. Simply call the contract or use your sponsored wallet for a mainnet transaction. You should shortly see the sponsored transactions list populating with these transactions - all gas free.

</Step>

## Ecosystem Gas Sponsorship

We also offer the capability to sponsor all transactions for your ecosystem where we orchestrate a number of signers through our relayer at the chain level. This means any developer building on your ecosystem as well as any user of Sequence wallets has the best onboarding and UX experience possible.
