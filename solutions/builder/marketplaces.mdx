Sequence Builder provides game builders with a white-label marketplace that can be launched in seconds. With Builder, you can customize your marketplace and integrate it directly into your game experience, all with no-coding experience necessary.

## Try it out

<Note>
Get started quickly at [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build/) to launch your marketplace.

##### Why would I want my own Marketplace for my web3 game?

Builder gives you full control over everything in your marketplace, from enforcing royalties (with ERC-2981) to
choosing the best trading mechanism for your community, setting fees, and more.
You can also aggregate listings from major platforms like OpenSea or LooksRare, providing you with the benefit of existing liquidity without relinquishing control of the gaming experience.
