title: "Wallet SDKs in Sequence Builder"
description: The Sequence Builder offers various SDK options for integrating Sequence Wallet into projects. By selecting Web SDK, Web SDK, Unity SDK, or Unreal SDK in the Wallets SDK section, users can easily input wallet details and generate code snippets for integration.

Sequence Builder offers multiple SDK options for integrating Sequence Wallet into your project.

### How can I integrate a Wallet into my game with these options?
In the Wallets SDK section of Builder, simply select **Web SDK**, input wallet details, click 'save', and code snippets will be generated for you to use. The same can be done for **Web SDK** (watch the tutorial below for additional guidance). **Unity SDK** and **Unreal SDK** will help you integrate the same way, but by interacting their respective game engines. Note that both SDKs are receiving updates and will be available shortly.

### What are the differences between these options?
**Web SDK** and **Web SDK** both deploy our Universal Wallet. They integrate differently, but offer the similar wallet benefits. However, **Web SDK** is also a wallet connector, providing additional benefits.

**Web SDK** is a powerful wallet connector, enabling existing wallet users across web3 to connect a wallet - vastly improving their user experience through embedded item views, integrated NFT checkout, and seamless wallet creation.

**The Unity SDK** integrates Wallet & Indexer functionality into games developed with the Unity Engine. Similarly, the **Unreal SDK** is an integration for games built with the Unreal Engine.

### What are the benefits of each and how can I leverage them?

All integrations provide non-custodial smart contract wallets with account abstraction benefits, including email and social login, gasless transactions, and more.

**Web SDK** benefits from also being a wallet connector, which you can leverage to cater to both existing wallet holders and millions of potential new users. The embedded wallet views, integrated NFT checkout, and seamless wallet creation ensure that users never need to leave the game or app.

**Unity SDK** and **Unreal SDK** give you the advantages of integrating a Sequence Wallet directly into your game.
