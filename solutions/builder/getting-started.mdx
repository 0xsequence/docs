Signing up and creating a project is easy to do with Sequence Builder and should take you less than a few minutes. In this tutorial, we will help you sign up for Builder and then create your first project.

Let's get started!

## Sign up for Sequence Builder

<Steps>

<Step title="Go to the Sequence Builder platform">

Go to [sequence.build](https://sequence.build/) and click on the `Start Building` or `Sign in` button to get started.
<Frame>

</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Choose a sign in method">

When you first sign in to Builder, a wallet is created for you.

You may, however, already have a Sequence wallet. If you are signed in with that wallet, you will see an option to use it.

Without a wallet, you will be given a few options to sign in. You can use any of the social sign ins, or you can simply use your email to get started.

</Step>
<Step title="Sign in to sequence.build">

After choosing how you would like to sign in, you will be presented with the terms of use. To read the `Terms of Use`, `Privacy Policy`, and `Master Services Agreement`, click on the respective links for each.

</Frame>
Once you have read each, click through to continue.

You are now signed in to Builder!
</Step>
<Step title="Create a Project">

Everything you do in Builder is centered around each project - so let's start one.

The easiest way to start a project is to simply click `+ Create Project`.
<Frame>

</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Enter the project details">

A modal will pop up, allowing you to enter details about your project. Provide a project name and, if you like, add an avatar for the project.

Then, select the network(s) on which you would like to start deploying. This can always be changed later.

</Step>
<Step title="Create the project!">

Now hit the `Create new Project` button!

</Frame>
Once you finish, you should now be viewing your project dashboard.
</Step>
<Step title="Claim an API Access Key">

Finally, to start building you'll need to claim an access key from the Builder, which can be accomplished by navigating to your `project` in the top left corner, selecting `Settings` in the side nav, and selecting the `API Access Keys` card
<Frame>
![open project settings](/images/builder/builder_open_access_key_settings.png)
</Frame>
Within the `settings` of the `API Access Keys` select the `dev` access key, which is typically used for development environments, whereas the `prod` key is used for production environments for applications in front of your users.

</Step>
<Step title="(Optional for Development) Create a Service Account">

In order to integrate some services from the Sequence stack, a Service Account has to be created to make updates or read from state - including [Collections API](/guides/metadata-guide) or [Webhooks](/api-references/indexer/examples/webhook-listener) - a `Secret API Key` is required.

One can navigate to the API Access Keys section by selecting the project, accessing the sidebar nav page of `Settings`, and selecting the `API Access Keys` card
<Frame>
![open project settings](/images/builder/builder_open_access_key_settings.png)
</Frame>
And scroll to the bottom, where you will find the `Secret API Access Key(s)` section

Where you would select `+ Add Service Account`
<Frame>
![secret API keys](/images/builder/builder_service_accounts_create_secret_api_key.png)
</Frame>
And either create a `Read` key, or, a `Write` secret API access key.

For making updates to the Sequence system, select `Write` and `+ Add Service Account` to include in your integration.
<Frame>

</Frame>
Copy the JWT token and save it somewhere safe, or, in your project

<Warning>
  Warning: You won't have access to the generated `Secret API Access Key` in the future from the Builder interface, make sure to save it somewhere safe.
</Warning>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Build things!

Now that you have created a project and claimed an API Access key, there is so much you can do from here.
