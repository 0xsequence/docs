2. **Advanced**: Update your [theme](/support/builder/project-settings#2-advanced-settings)
3. **Collaborators**: Add [collaborators](/support/builder/project-settings#add-a-collaborator) or create [invite links](/support/builder/project-settings#create-an-invite-link)
4. **Networks**: Update the [networks](/support/builder/project-settings#4-network-settings) your project is using
5. **API Access Keys**: Copy [keys](/support/builder/project-settings#copy-your-access-key) and [configure existing keys](/support/builder/project-settings#update-api-access-settings-of-a-key)
6. **Billing**: Update your [project plan](/support/builder/project-settings#update-your-project-subscription-plan) or set [overage limits](/support/builder/project-settings#set-your-overage-limit)

The final action you can take in settings is to [delete your project](/support/builder/project-settings#delete-a-project).

Settings are configured per project, so let's start by navigating to the settings of a specific project.
