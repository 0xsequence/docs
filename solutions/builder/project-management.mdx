Creation of projects is seamless in just several clicks. This process requires no KYC, only that users comply with Global [regulations and policies](https://support.sequence.xyz/en/article/sequence-list-of-restricted-regions-1eked2s/), and an agreement to the platforms' terms of service.

#### Project Name

Choose a `project name` - something playful, serious, or just something unique to distinguish your new project amongst the other projects linked to your wallet.

#### Avatar

Upload a custom `avatar` to your project that displays aspects of your identity you want to be included as part of your project, or, something specific to the theme of what you're building. [You can always update your collaborators](/support/builder/project-settings#watch-how-to-invite-collaborators) and coordinate across the internet so Avatars can be a stepping stone to trust.

#### Configure networks

Configure 1 or multiple `networks` for a single project from the 11 offered production / mainnet networks, or, 8 test networks, with a simple flip of a toggle. At any point, the networks for your project chosen can be updated in the settings.

All 3 of these values: `Project name`, your `avatar`, and your configured `networks` can be changed later.
