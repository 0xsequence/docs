Guest Wallets are a feature in the Sequence Stack that allow for ephemeral creation of an authentication idenity that lasts till the user clears their browser cache, or, sign's in again.

This strategy for onboarding can be useful for providing ways to freely access your app/game or experience, increasing your conversion rate until users want to persist their information.

Importantly, if users clear their cache or lose access to the device - any assets in the Guest Wallet will not be recoverable. Therefore, users should connect an additional authentication method if any value is associated with the wallet.

<Warning>
The Guest Wallet feature is currently in early access. To enable it, please visit https://sequence.build/earlyaccess and turn on the functionality.

To configure the Embedded Wallet for Guest Wallet, this can be accomplished with the following steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Builder Configuration">

Access your project in Sequence builder, navigate to the Embedded Wallet Configuration section, then add a Login Provider:
<Frame>

</Frame>
Finally, selecting `Guest Wallet` in the dropdown.
<Frame>
![select guest wallet](/images/builder/builder_guess_wallet_select_provider.png)
</Frame>
And selecting the purple `Update configuration` to input your password to update the Configuration.
</Step>
<Step title="Implementation">

Once configured, you can implement a Guest Wallet with the following code and use it like any other Embedded Wallet:

```typescript App.tsx
await sequence.signIn({ guest: true }, "Session name");
```
</Step>
