## MCP Server

The Sequence MCP Server allows you to leverage AI agents like Claude or Cursor seamlessly with Sequence.

The server is available at:

`https://docs.sequence.xyz/mcp`

### Connect in Cursor

1. Use <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> on Windows) to open the command palette.
2. Search for "Open MCP settings".
3. Select **Add custom MCP** to open the `mcp.json` file.
4. In `mcp.json`, add the Sequence server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Sequence": {
      "url": "https://docs.sequence.xyz/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

5. In Cursor chat, ask "What tools do you have available?" to confirm the Sequence MCP server is listed.

See the [Cursor documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/en/context/mcp#installing-mcp-servers) for more details.

### Connect in Claude

1. Navigate to the [Developers] page in Claude Desktop.
2. Select **Edit config** if you have an existing MCP configuration or add a new one.
3. Open your config file and add the Sequence MCP server:
   - Name: `Sequence`
   - URL: `https://docs.sequence.xyz/mcp`
4. Save the configuration
5. In a Claude chat, select the `Search and tools` and make sure your configuration file with Sequence is enabled.
6. Ask a question about Sequence!

See the [Model Context Protocol docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tutorials/use-remote-mcp-server#connecting-to-a-remote-mcp-server) for more details.

### Example Queries

You can ask questions like:
- "How do I integrate Sequence embedded wallets?"
- "How do I use Sequence to query token balances?"
- "What chains does Sequence support?"

When your query is being processed, you'll see an indication like:
