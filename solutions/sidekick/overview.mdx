# Sequence Sidekick üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Sequence Sidekick provides a fully equipped backend, leveraging Sequence's infrastructure to streamline blockchain interactions for developers. With Sidekick, you can programmatically perform the following operations using your own backend wallet:

- Pre-configured backend services: Redis, PostgreSQL, Transaction API, and an Indexer‚Äîall set up and ready to use.
- Effortless deployment: Spin up your backend in minutes with a single command to create a Docker container.
- Flexible wallet options: Use a Sequence Smart Wallet with locally managed private keys or securely integrate AWS/GCP KMS for enhanced security.
- Seamless contract deployment: Deploy ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, or custom smart contracts via API calls.
- Reliable transaction management: Read from and write to any contract for your game or app, with automatic nonce management, gas bumping, and other optimizations ensuring efficient execution.
- Webhook integration: Leverage our high-performance indexer to fully manage webhooks.
- Optimized gas pricing: Transactions are submitted at optimal gas prices, with automatic resubmission if not included in the mempool within three blocks.
- Built-in user rewards system: Set up self-claimed or recurring user rewards (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155) with a single API call.
- Built-in Bull MQ Dashboard: Monitor and manage your background jobs.
- Swagger UI: Explore the API documentation and test the endpoints with the Swagger UI
- Contract utilities: Easily check contract deployments on different chains.
- Seamless Sequence Builder integration: Import all your Sequence Builder contracts into the Sidekick backend with one API call, or manually add custom contracts.

## About the backend wallet
All transactions executed through Sidekick use a Sequence smart wallet, which is [automatically created](https://github.com/0xsequence-demos/sequence-sidekick/blob/e76a47d0b9ef19f23736c1e8f863ed4795b855a8/src/utils/wallet.ts#L25) for the externally owned account (EOA) specified by you, leveraging our infrastructure for optimized and performant execution.

To configure the backend wallet, you can:
- Declare your [EVM_PRIVATE_KEY](https://github.com/0xsequence-demos/sequence-sidekick/blob/e76a47d0b9ef19f23736c1e8f863ed4795b855a8/.env.example#L16) in the .env file for a local setup (not recommended for production)
- Use the recommended method: setting up [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) or [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/kms) KMS and adding the necessary credentials in the .env file. 

<Note>
To find out what are the required credentials for local, AWS, or GCP wallet configurations, please refer to the [env.example](https://github.com/0xsequence-demos/sequence-sidekick/blob/master/.env.example) file.
</Note>

<Note>
Make sure you choose the correct key types in AWS KMS and GCP KMS.
- AWS KMS: `ECC_NIST_P256_KEY_ALIAS`
- GCP KMS: `GCP_KEY_RING_NAME`
</Note>

Sidekick is built to integrate seamlessly with AWS and GCP KMS, allowing you to use your KMS signer. We've developed [adapters](https://github.com/orgs/0xsequence/repositories?q=kms) that make AWS/GCP KMS compatible with the ethers signer type, ensuring compatibility with the latest version.

Sequence Sidekick empowers developers with a scalable, plug-and-play backend solution for blockchain-based applications, allowing you to focus on building without backend complexities.

<Callout type="warning">
When using the Sequence Sidekick:
- `msg.sender` will be the Sequence Wallet address of your EOA, not your EOA address
- `tx.origin` will be one of the Sequence Relayer addresses
- Ensure proper permissions are granted for contract function calls to the Sequence Wallet address
- View active relayer addresses in the [mainnet status page](https://mainnet-relayer.sequence.app/status)

```
</Step>

<Step title="Setup the required environment variables">

### Required Environment Variables

| Variable | Description 
|----------|-------------
| PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY | Access key from Sequence Builder API Keys 
| SECRET_KEY | Your custom secret Sidekick key 
| SEQUENCE_RPC_URL | RPC URL from Sequence 
| BUILDER_API_SECRET_KEY | Secret key from Sequence Builder API Keys | `eyJh...` |
| INDEXER_URL | Indexer URL based on network 
| SIGNER_TYPE | Type of signer to use 

### Wallet Configuration Variables

Choose one of the following configurations:

##### Local Wallet:
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| EVM_PRIVATE_KEY | Private key for the EOA used to sign transactions |

##### AWS KMS Configuration:
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| AWS_REGION | AWS account region |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | AWS access key ID |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | AWS secret access key |

</Step>

<Step title="Make sure you have Docker installed">

Get it from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

</Step>

<Step title="Start Sidekick in a Docker container">

```shell
pnpm docker:start
```
</Step>

<Step title="Make your first API call to get back smart wallet address">

```shell
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:3000/sidekick/smart-account-address'
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Dev mode without Docker
If you want to make changes to the codebase and test them without Docker, you can run the backend locally by following the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/0xsequence-demos/sequence-sidekick/blob/master/README.md).

## Gas Sponsorship
On testnet, we sponsor all the transactions. However, on mainnet - you will want to ensure that you sponsor the transactions in order to ensure that they process correctly by sponsoring the contract itself. You can take a deeper look at our [Gas Sponsorship](/solutions/builder/gas-tank) solution to learn how to do this.
