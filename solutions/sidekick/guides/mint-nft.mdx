title: Mint NFTs
description: This example demonstrates how to mint an NFT using Sidekick.
---

When using Sidekick, your private key is associated with a Sequence smart account. Before performing actions like minting NFTs or transferring tokens, ensure this smart account has the necessary permissions to execute these operations.

Below we will illustrate the steps to prepare and mint ERC1155's using Sidekick.

<Note>
    This example assumes the ERC1155 Access Control is Role Based. 
</Note>

<Note>
    Your Sidekick smart wallet should be the new `owner` now if you plan to execute transactions from Sidekick. It won't work to mint new tokens if you do not transfer ownership 
    to the Sidekick smart wallet or use Role Based Access Control and grant the minter role to the Sidekick smart wallet.
</Note>

## Mint an NFT with Role Based Access Control
<Steps>
    <Step title="Complete Sidekick Setup">
        Make sure you have gone through the [Sidekick Setup](/solutions/sidekick/overview) guide.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Get your Sidekick smart wallet address">
        Send a GET request to the `/sidekick/smart-account-address` endpoint to retrieve your Sidekick smart wallet address. This address will be used to interact with your NFT contracts.

        ></video>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Grant the minter role to the Sidekick smart wallet address from the contract" />
    <Step title="Mint the NFT">
        Now that your Sidekick smart wallet has the minter role, you can send a POST request to the `/write/erc1155/{chainId}/{contractAddress}/mint` endpoint to mint an NFT from the backend.
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
    If your NFT is not Role Based, instead of granting the minter role you will need to transfer ownership of the contract to the Sidekick smart wallet.
</Note>
