    #### MOCKDATA + es-translated Sequence Market

    MOCKDATA + es-translated This marketplace type enables users to create custom listings and offers on a decentralized orderbook, available for anyone to partake in commerce, allowing for time expiry of orders, custom pricing, and ERC20 custom currency types, as well as other features.

In that case, they will no longer be listed by default on the Sequence Marketplace, but Sequence will still detect and display them seamlessly. This setup gives you full flexibility over distribution while keeping your NFTs visible both on your custom marketplace and across the broader NFT ecosystem.
