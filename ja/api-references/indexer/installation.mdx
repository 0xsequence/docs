Sequence Indexer is a simple API to query any blockchain token and NFT data. Below are instructions
on how to integrate the Sequence Indexer API into your Webapps, Games, and backends. In case you missed
it, please also see the [Indexer Overview](/api-references/indexer/overview).

## Installation
The Sequence Indexer is built as a HTTP API with RPC endpoints that you may call directly
from your Webapp, Game or server backend. Below you'll find information on the RPC endpoint
schema with sample curl commands, along with examples in both Javascript/Typescript and Go.

We provide SDKs for [Web / node.js](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence.js) and [Go](https://github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence).
Or if you'd like to integrate the Indexer with another language target, simply follow the API reference below
to implement the HTTP requests. Additionally, read the Typescript client source code as [reference
implementation of the Indexer API client](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence.js/blob/master/packages/indexer/src/indexer.gen.ts) as well.

### Web / node.js Installation

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm install 0xsequence ethers
  ```

  or

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm install 0xsequence ethers
  ```

  or

  ```bash yarn
  yarn add 0xsequence ethers
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  This code requires an API Access Key from [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build).
</Note>

```ts
import { SequenceIndexer } from '@0xsequence/indexer'

// see https://docs.sequence.xyzhttps://status.sequence.info for list of
// indexer hosts for the chain you'd like to query
const indexer = new SequenceIndexer('https://mainnet-indexer.sequence.app', 'AQAAAAAAAF_JvPALhBthL7VGn6jV0YDqaFY')

// see examples below for the kinds of queries you can make
const tokenBalances = await indexer.getTokenBalances(...)
```

**NOTE:** if you're using `@0xsequence/indexer` from node.js, we recommend using node v18.x or newer.

### Go Installation

```bash Terminal
go get -u github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence@latest
```

then in your app,

```go Go
import (
	"github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence/indexer"
)

// see https://docs.sequence.xyzhttps://status.sequence.info for list of
// indexer hosts for the chain you'd like to query
seqIndexer := indexer.NewIndexer("https://polygon-indexer.sequence.app", "AQAAAAAAAF_JvPALhBthL7VGn6jV0YDqaFY")

// see examples below for the kinds of queries you can make
accountAddress := "ACCOUNT_ADDRESS"
includeMetadata := true
metadataOptions := indexer.MetadataOptions{
	VerifiedOnly: true,
}

_, tokenBalances, err := seqIndexer.GetTokenBalances(context.Background(), &accountAddress, nil, nil, &includeMetadata, &metadataOptions, nil, nil)
```

### Unity or Unreal Installation
The Sequence Indexer is integrated directly inside of the respective [Sequence Unity](/sdk/unity/) and [Sequence Unreal](/sdk/unreal/introduction) SDKs.
