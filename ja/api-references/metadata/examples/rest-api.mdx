title: Metadata REST API Reference & Usage
sidebarTitle: REST API
---

The Sequence Metadata API service offers a simple and fast API to query token & NFT metadata
for Ethereum-compatible chains.

Quite simply, the Metadata API allows you to query the token metadata of any ERC20, ERC721 or ERC1155
contract on a [number of supported Ethereum chains](https://status.sequence.info).

As well, the Sequence Metadata service is automatically integrated in the [Sequence Indexer](/api-references/indexer/overview).
But as we demonstrate below, it's also useful to be able to query the token/contract metadata directly too :)

<Note>
  \[PRO TIP: RPC vs REST endpoints]

  Sequence Metadata service is available with both RPC and REST endpoints. We recommend the RPC endpoints
  for your application, but the REST endpoints are an available option for convenience.

  For RPC endpoint see [Token metadata RPC](/api-references/metadata/examples/token-metadata) and [Contract metadata RPC](/api-references/metadata/examples/contract-metadata).
</Note>

## 例
Let's say you'd like to query the metadata of a Skyweaver 1155 card on the Polygon network. Of course,  the
below example will work for any network / contract / token combination as well.

First, the Skyweaver 1155 assets contract is located at address `0x631998e91476DA5B870D741192fc5Cbc55F5a52E`
on the Polygon network. Second, let's build the metadata lookup endpoint to query Skyweaver's contract
for token ID `20`:

[Request](https://metadata.sequence.app/tokens/polygon/0x631998e91476DA5B870D741192fc5Cbc55F5a52E/20)

**Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "tokenId": "20",
    "contractAddress": "0x631998e91476da5b870d741192fc5cbc55f5a52e",
    "name": "Unstoppable Chop",
    "description": "Attach Silence to target unit. Do 4 damage to it.",
    "image": "https://assets.skyweaver.net/TNqWLuJZ/webapp/cards/full-cards/6x/20-silver.png",
    "decimals": 2,
    "properties": {
      "baseCardId": 20,
      "goldCardId": 131092,
      "grade": "oldSilver",
      "id": 20,
      "silverCardId": 65556
    },
    "attributes": null
  }
]
```

If you'd like to query a number of tokens at the same time, you can include more token ids comma-separated [https://metadata.sequence.app/tokens/polygon/0x.../20,21,22](https://metadata.sequence.app/tokens/polygon/0x631998e91476DA5B870D741192fc5Cbc55F5a52E/20,21,22) -- click
to see the JSON response to query token ids `20`, `21`, and `22` in a single batched request.

Feel free to try tweaking the metadata.sequence.app URL above for your own contract, or another popular
project to see how the responses come back. You can change the network to [one of our supported networks](/)
and specify any contract and/or token id.

In addition to easily querying _token-level metadata_ like in the above example, you can also query _contract-level metadata_.
Contract-level metadata provides you more information about a contract address such as a name, contract type, logo, and description.
Simply change the metadata URL above to just query the [contract address](https://metadata.sequence.app/tokens/polygon/0x631998e91476DA5B870D741192fc5Cbc55F5a52E)

and see result:

```json
{
  "chainId": 137,
  "address": "0x631998e91476da5b870d741192fc5cbc55f5a52e",
  "name": "Skyweaver",
  "type": "ERC1155",
  "symbol": "SKYWVR",
  "logoURI": "https://assets.skyweaver.net/_tX5dRVi/webapp/icons/skyweaver-token.png",
  "extensions": {
    "link": "https://www.skyweaver.net/",
    "description": "Skyweaver is a Free-to-Play, trading card game powered by Polygon and Ethereum.",
    "ogImage": "https://skyweaver.net/images/skyweavercover.jpg",
    "originAddress": "0x631998e91476da5b870d741192fc5cbc55f5a52e"
  }
}
```

## Usage
The Metadata API service is accessible either with a simple [REST interface](#rest-endpoints), or a [RPC client](#rpc-client).
For the RPC client, we offer Web browser, node and Go clients. We recommend the RPC client for most integrations, but
make the REST interface available for convenience.

## REST endpoints
As mentioned in the [example](#example) above. The general format of the REST endpoint is:

```
GET https://metadata.sequence.app/tokens/<network>/<contractAddress>[/<tokenID>]
```

Where `<network>` must be one of the `Chain ID` or `Chain Handle` of [the supported networks](/).

**Fetch contract-level metadata:**

```
GET https://metadata.sequence.app/tokens/<network>/<contractAddress>
```

[Example](https://metadata.sequence.app/tokens/polygon/0x631998e91476DA5B870D741192fc5Cbc55F5a52E)

**Fetch token-level metadata:**

```
GET https://metadata.sequence.app/tokens/<network>/<contractAddress>/<tokenID>[,<tokenID>,...]
```

Examples:
- [token ID 20](https://metadata.sequence.app/tokens/polygon/0x631998e91476DA5B870D741192fc5Cbc55F5a52E/20)
- [token ID 20 & 21](https://metadata.sequence.app/tokens/polygon/0x631998e91476DA5B870D741192fc5Cbc55F5a52E/20,21)

## RPC Client
The Metadata RPC interface offers the full capabilities of the Metadata service.

We provide SDKs for [Web / node.js](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence.js) and [Go](https://github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence).
Or if you'd like to integrate the Metadata service with another language target, simply follow the API reference below
to implement the HTTP requests. Additionally, read the Typescript client source code as [reference
implementation of the Metadata RPC client](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence.js/blob/master/packages/metadata/src/metadata.gen.ts) as well.

## Metadata RPC Methods
**Metadata API endpoint:** [https://metadata.sequence.app](https://metadata.sequence.app)

**Metadata RPC methods:**
- `GetTokenMetadata` - fetch token metadata of ERC721 or ERC1155 tokens from a single contract
- `GetTokenMetadataBatch` - fetch token metadata of ERC721 or ERC1155 token from a batch of contracts
- `GetContractInfo` - fetch contract metadata of an ERC20, ERC721 or ERC1155 contract address
- `GetContractInfoBatch` - fetch contract metadata of a batch of ERC20, ERC721 or ERC1155 contract addresses
- `SearchContracts` - fetch contract metadata info based on search criteria for ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 tokens
