# Indexer Gateway
The Sequence Indexer Gateway API is a powerful tool for simultaneously
performing queries across multiple chains. By Leveraging Indexer, the Indexer
Gateway allows you to find and filter data across the Ethereum chains we
support.

The API is not only modeled after Indexer, it actually uses Indexer behind the
scenes, so you can take your code that already works with Indexer and make it
multi-chain with just a few modifications.

## Supported Networks & Endpoints
The Indexer Gateway endpoints accept a list of network IDs (e.g.: `[1, 137,
10]`) or a list of network names (e.g.: `["mainnet", "polygon", "optimism"]`).

You can see the [full list of supported networks
here](https://status.sequence.info).

## はじめに
Here are a few example queries you can make to multiple networks from your
dapp, game, or wallet:
-   [Fetch tokens & NFTS in any wallet across all chains, including
    metadata](/api-references/indexer-gateway/examples/get-token-balances)

-   [Fetch native balances across all
    chains](/api-references/indexer-gateway/examples/get-native-token-balances)

-   [Fetch balance updates across all
    chains](/api-references/indexer-gateway/examples/get-balance-updates)

-   [Fetch tokens with advanced
    filters](/api-references/indexer-gateway/examples/get-token-balances-details)

-   [Fetch tokens, by contract, with advanced
    filters](/api-references/indexer-gateway/examples/get-token-balances-by-contract)
