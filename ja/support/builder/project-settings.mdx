2. **Advanced**: Update your [theme](/support/builder/project-settings#2-advanced-settings)

4. **Networks**: Update the [networks](/support/builder/project-settings#4-network-settings) your project is using
5. **API Access Keys**: Copy [keys](/support/builder/project-settings#copy-your-access-key) and [configure existing keys](/support/builder/project-settings#update-api-access-settings-of-a-key)
6. **Billing**: Update your [project plan](/support/builder/project-settings#update-your-project-subscription-plan) or set [overage limits](/support/builder/project-settings#set-your-overage-limit)

The final action you can take in settings is to [delete your project](/support/builder/project-settings#delete-a-project).

Settings are configured per project, so let's start by navigating to the settings of a specific project.

## Getting to Settings in Builder

The first method is to directly add collaborators by entering their information and selecting their access level.

The second method is to create an invite link. When using this option, you can specify the access level, link duration, and optional usage limits.

Let's walk through each of these.
