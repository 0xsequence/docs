title: "Token Directory"
description: The Token Directory by Sequence is an open resource on GitHub used to filter spam from verified tokens. Users can manually add new tokens to be visible in wallets and infrastructure by updating wallet settings or the token directory.
---

When tokens are added to various blockchains, the default is for these tokens to not be included in the default wallet settings since a lot of tokens can be considering spam until they are verified.

The best way to get your contracts verified is to deploy them through the Sequence Builder which will add them to our token directory automatically.

We also support verifying external contracts and collections, to do this - please get in [contact](https://go.crisp.chat/chat/embed/?website_id=9ef4395b-6bb1-4645-8e02-6071d89290a1).

Otherwise, if you are deploying tokens for testing - you can also configure your Sequence Wallet to show unverified tokens.

## How to make tokens appear in your wallet

From your Sequence Wallet in Builder, navigate to [Settings > General](https://sequence.app/settings/general) and untoggle `Hide Unverified Tokens`.

<Warning>
  Note <br />
  This will show all unverified tokens which can be utilized for testing purposes.
