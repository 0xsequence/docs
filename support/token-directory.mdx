title: "Token Directory"
description: Sequence Token Directory is an open resource repository on GitHub used to filter spam tokens from our services and wallets. Developers can submit pull requests to the Token Directory to get new tokens verified in wallets and infrastructure.

When new token contracts are deployed to a blockchain supported by Sequence, they are not automatically visible in wallets and infrastructure since they are not verified and might be considered spam.

The best way to get your contracts automatically verified is to deploy them through the Sequence Builder which will add them to our token directory immediately. Alternatively, you can import your contracts into your project in Builder and they will be automatically verified as well.

We also support verifying external contracts and collections. Simply open a Pull Request with the contract information against the [Token Directory](https://github.com/0xsequence/token-directory).


Otherwise, if you are deploying tokens for testing - you can also configure your Sequence Wallet to show unverified tokens.

## How to make unverified tokens appear in your wallet

Launch your [Sequence Wallet](https://sequence.app/), navigate to [Settings > General](https://sequence.app/settings/general) and untoggle `Hide Unverified Tokens`.

<Warning>
  This will show all unverified tokens, including spam tokens.
