sidebarTitle: Cross App Integration

Sequence's cross-app solution enables your users to leverage your ecosystem embedded wallets in any app with the same wallet address - regardless of whether they are external to your ecosystem or integrated with Sequence using common wallet connectors like wagmi. This includes:

- External Marketplaces
- External DEX's
- External Applications

<Note>
You can see a demo of our cross-app embedded wallet connector [here](https://cross-app-demo-dapp.pages.dev/).
</Note>

The cross-app embedded wallet implements a communication flow between the external application and the wallet application:

- The external app communicates with the wallet through the cross-app embedded wallet connector for Wagmi
- The connector uses a ProviderTransport to handle communication
- Messages are sent between the ProviderTransport and WalletTransport
- The Wallet component handles three main functionalities:
  - User Authentication
  - Transaction Signing
  - Message Signing

The wallet can be opened and send messages back to the external application through the transport layer, enabling secure cross-application communication. Notably, for a cross-app integration, users will have to confirm all interactions.

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone our Cross App Embedded Wallet App & connector">

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xsequence/cross-app-embedded-wallet/tree/master && cd cross-app-embedded-Wallet/wallet
cp .env.example .env
```
</Step>
<Step title="Update Wallet Transport with your configuration">

Pass in your ecosystem embedded wallet variables to the `.env` file. Then simply build the wallet application with `pnpm build` and deploy to your preferred such as Cloudflare Pages with a publicly accessible URL.
</Step>
<Step title="Example External Application Configuration">
Now, we'll configure an example external application where we pass in the wallet connector URL to wagmi. 

Navigate to the example application and install dependencies, specifically the sequence cross-app connector package `@sequence-wallet/cross-app-connector`:

```bash
cd ../dapp && pnpm install
```

Then update the environment variables with our project access key and the hosted wallet URL you deployed previously:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
</Step>
<Step title="Update Wagmi Connector">
Lastly, you can edit the wagmi connector configuration located in `src/wagmiConfig.ts` for your specific wallet. Here's an example configuration that can be provided to the external application:

```
import { sequenceCrossAppEmbeddedWallet } from '@0xsequence/cross-app-embedded-wallet-connector'
import { createConfig, http } from 'wagmi'
import { arbitrumNova, arbitrumSepolia } from 'wagmi/chains'

const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)
const walletAppUrl = urlParams.get('walletAppUrl') ?? import.meta.env.VITE_WALLET_URL

const connector = sequenceCrossAppEmbeddedWallet(
  {
    projectAccessKey: import.meta.env.VITE_PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY,
    walletUrl: walletAppUrl,
    chainId: arbitrumNova.id, // Change this to your desired chain
  }
);

export const config = createConfig({
  chains: [arbitrumNova, arbitrumSepolia],
  connectors: [connector],
  transports: {
    [arbitrumNova.id]: http(), // add Chain ID Transport
    [arbitrumSepolia.id]: http()
  }
})
```
</Step>
</Steps>

Now, you can share the wallet connector configuration with any app to allow them to leverage your ecosystem wallet in their application so your using can use their same wallet address.
