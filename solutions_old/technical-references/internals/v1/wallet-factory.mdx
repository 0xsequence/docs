title: "Wallet Factory"
description: The Wallet Factory allows for the creation of Sequence Wallets using the Factory contract, which generates child MinimalUpgradeableProxies that serve as the base code for all Sequence wallets.

Sequence Wallets are created using the [Factory](https://github.com/0xsequence/wallet-contracts/blob/e0c5382636a88b4db4bcf0a70623355d7cd30fb4/contracts/Factory.sol) contract, when called it creates child [MinimalUpgradeableProxies](https://github.com/0xsequence/wallet-contracts/blob/e0c5382636a88b4db4bcf0a70623355d7cd30fb4/contracts/Wallet.sol) contracts, which are in essence the "boot" code of all Sequence wallets.

## Factory API

### deploy

```solidity
  function deploy(
    address _mainModule,
    bytes32 _salt
  ) public payable returns (address _contract)
```

Creates a child MinimalUpgradeableProxy using [CREATE2](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1014), the proxy initially points to the provided `_mainModule`.
No initialize code is executed.

#### Parameters:

| Name         | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| \_mainModule | address | Initial implementation for the new proxy contract, expected to point to a valid Sequence wallet implementation with support for counter-factual initialization.          |
| \_salt       | bytes32 | Arbitrary value to be used as `create2` salt. Sequence's `mainModule` uses the salt to obtain a hash with the initial configuration for the wallet (See [ImageHash](#)). |

#### Return Values:

| Name       | Type    | Description                            |
| ---------- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| \_contract | address | Address of the created proxy contract. |

<Warning>
  Unsanitized input <br />
  The Factory contract **does not** check if the provided `_mainModule` is a valid Sequence wallet implementation, or if `_salt` is a valid Sequence configuration.

Using invalid parameters will result on a proxy contract that **may not** be usable, and could result in loss of funds.

</Warning>

## Counter factual addresses

Sequence wallets are counter-factual by design, this means that the wallet's address can be known before the wallet is deployed; any two combinations of the `mainModule` and `salt` values will result in the same wallet address.

This property alongside the use of [NanoUniversalDeployer](/solutions/technical-references/internals/v1/deploy#1-deploy-nanouniversaldeployer) or [UniversalDeployer](/solutions/technical-references/internals/v1/deploy#2-deploy-universaldeployer2) is the reason why Sequence wallets can obtain the same address on multiple chains.

<Tip>
  Gas-free wallet creation <br /> Sequence wallets are **100% counterfactual**,
  meaning that funds can be safely transferred to the wallet's address without
  the need for calling the `deploy` function. Deploying the wallet is only
  required before the first transaction is sent **from** the wallet.
