The following steps are required to deploy the [Sequence Wallet Context](/solutions_old/technical-references/internals/v1/wallet-context) on a new network.

<Note>
  Notice <br />
  For most popular networks this process **is not** required; due to the wallet contracts
  being already deployed.
  To see if a configuration already exists for a given chain go to [Networks](https://status.sequence.info).

### 1 - Deploy Singleton Factory

The Singleton Factory is a contract that allows the deployment of a single contract instance per address. Unlike the
[Universal Deployer](#universal-deployer), the Singleton Factory requires a salt to manage deployment instances. More information about the
Singleton Factory can be found in the [EIP-2470 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2470).

The Pre-fund the Singleton Factory's deployer with the required funds to deploy the contract.

```
Address: 0xBb6e024b9cFFACB947A71991E386681B1Cd1477D
Funds: 0.0247
```

**Do not send additional funds to the address, as funds can't be refunded.**

Once the address is funded, you can deploy the Singleton Factory by executing the following pre-signed transaction:

```
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
```

After the transaction is confirmed, you should see the address of the Singleton Factory:

```
Singleton Deployer: 0xce0042B868300000d44A59004Da54A005ffdcf9f
```

### 2 - Deploy Wallet Context

Deploy each of the contracts in the [Sequence Wallet Context](/solutions_old/technical-references/internals/v1/wallet-context) using the Singleton Factory.

A script can be found in the [Sequence Wallet Contracts repository](https://github.com/0xsequence/wallet-contracts/).

Clone the repository, configure the environment variables and run the script with:

```
yarn deploy <network>
```
