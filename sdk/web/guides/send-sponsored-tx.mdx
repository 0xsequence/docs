<Step title="Setup Web SDK">

Make sure you completed the [Getting Started](/sdk/web/getting-started) guide.
</Step>

<Step title="Setup your Gas Tank (for Mainnet only)">

If you plan to send transactions on mainnet, you need to setup your gas tank. Go to [Gas Sponsorhip](/solutions/builder/gas-tank) to learn how to setup your gas tank.

<Note>
All Sequence smart wallet transactions are sponsored by default on testnets.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Send a sponsored transaction">

Next, we'll create a simple component to send a sponsored transaction.

```typescript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Button, Card, Select, Text } from '@0xsequence/design-system';
import { useAccount, useSendTransaction } from 'wagmi';

export const SponsoredTransactionExample = () => {
  const { address } = useAccount();

  const {
    sendTransaction,
    isPending,
    isSuccess,
    data: txHash
  } = useSendTransaction();

  const sendSponsoredTx = () => {
    if (!address) return;
    // Sending a dummy tx
    sendTransaction({
      to: address,
      value: BigInt(0),
      gas: null
    });
  };

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <Text>Address: {address}</Text>
        <Button onClick={sendSponsored}>Send Sponsored</Button>
        {isPending && <Text>Pending...</Text>}
        {isSuccess && <Text>Success! Tx Hash: {txHash}</Text>}
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
```
</Step>
</Steps>

Congratulations! You've just learned how to send a sponsored transaction using Sequence Kit.
