The power of smart swaps is intelligently detecting the currencies available to the user as well as batching multiple transactions together to if the user is utilizing a Sequence wallet to simplify the UX. You can say goodbye to separate `approve` and `transfer` transactions!

<Note>
If you intend to use smart swaps with your custom token, please ensure you provide sufficient liquidity for your token (preferably USDC, USDT, or ETH) on a supported DEX such as Uniswap.
</Note>

We support the following chains for swaps:

- Ethereum (Mainnet)
- Ethereum (Sepolia)
- Arbitrum
- Avalanche
- Base
- Blast
- BSC
- Optimism
- Polygon

# Installation and Setup
To integrate the Swap feature with Web SDK, follow these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the @0xsequence/checkout library">

```bash
npm install @0xsequence/checkout
# or
pnpm install @0xsequence/checkout
# or
yarn add @0xsequence/checkout
```

</Step>
<Step title="Place the `SequenceCheckoutProvider` below the `SequenceConnect` Provider in your App:">

```jsx
import { SequenceCheckoutProvider } from '@0xsequence/checkout'
import { SequenceConnect } from '@0xsequence/connect'
import { config } from './config'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <SequenceConnect config={config}>
      <SequenceCheckoutProvider>
        <Page />
      </SequenceCheckoutProvider>
    </SequenceConnect>
  )
}
```

</Step>
<Step title="Import Swap Dependencies and Logic">

- `currencyAddress`: The address of the token to swap from (e.g., USDC).
- `currencyAmount`: The amount to swap.
- `postSwapTransactions`: An optional array of transactions to be executed after the swap, using the swapped tokens.
- `title`: The modal's title.
- `description`: A description of the swap and payment process.

```jsx
import { useSwapModal, type SwapModalSettings } from '@0xsequence/checkout'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { openSwapModal } = useSwapModal()

  const onClick = () => {
    const chainId = 137
    const currencyAddress = '0x3c499c542cEF5E3811e1192ce70d8cC03d5c3359'
    const currencyAmount = '20000'

    const contractAbiInterface = new ethers.Interface(['function demo()']) // Optionally, replace with your contract's abi interface

    const data = contractAbiInterface.encodeFunctionData('demo', []) as `0x${string}` // Optionally, replace 'demo' with the function you want to call,

    const swapModalSettings: SwapModalSettings = {
      onSuccess: () => {
        console.log('swap successful!')
      },
      chainId,
      currencyAddress,
      currencyAmount,
      postSwapTransactions: [ // Optionally, replace with the transaction you would like to execute after the swap has taken place.
        {
          to: '0x37470dac8a0255141745906c972e414b1409b470',
          data
        }
      ],
      title: 'Swap and Pay',
      description: 'Select a token in your wallet to swap to 0.2 USDC.'
    }

    openSwapModal(swapModalSettings)
  }

  return <button onClick={onClick}>Swap and Pay</button>
}
```
</Step>
</Steps>

Congratulations! Youâ€™ve just learned how to use smart swaps with Web SDK.
