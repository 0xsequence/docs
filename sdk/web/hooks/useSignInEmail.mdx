```

## Usage

```tsx
import { useSignInEmail } from '@0xsequence/connect'

function App() {
  const email = useSignInEmail()
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>User Information</h2>
      {email ? (
        <div>
          <p>Connected with email: {email}</p>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <p>No email associated with connected wallet</p>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Return Type

```tsx
string | null
```

The hook returns:
- A `string` containing the email address when a wallet is connected and has an associated email
- `null` when:
  - No wallet is connected
  - The connected wallet has no associated email
  - The wallet has been disconnected

## State Management

The hook manages the email state by:
1. Monitoring the wallet connection status
2. Retrieving the stored email when a wallet connects
3. Clearing the email when the wallet disconnects
4. Persisting the email in local storage using the `WaasSignInEmail` key

## Notes

This hook is designed to work with both:
- Sequence WaaS (Wallet-as-a-Service) wallets
- Universal wallet types

Key features:
- Automatic email retrieval on wallet connection
- Persistent storage of email addresses
- Automatic cleanup on wallet disconnection
- Real-time connection status monitoring

Common use cases:
- Displaying user information in UI
- User identification
- Personalized experiences
- Account management interfaces
- Email verification flows

The hook integrates with Sequence's storage system to maintain email persistence across sessions while ensuring proper cleanup when wallets are disconnected.
