sidebarTitle: Getting Started
---



To spin up a quick boilerplate that leverages Sequence Kit, you can run the following command from your terminal to install the Sequence-CLI and create a react app:

```bash
npx sequence-cli boilerplates create-embedded-wallet-react-starter
```

Otherwise, we will walk you through the process of installing Sequence Kit, instantiating the connection modal, and displaying the Inventory in your application.

## Installing Sequence Kit Packages

Sequence Kit is modular, allowing you to install only the necessary packages. To get started, install the `@0xsequence/kit` core package, as well as install other dependencies such as `wagmi`, `viem`, and `0xsequence`.

```bash
npm install @0xsequence/kit @0xsequence/waas wagmi ethers@6.13.0 viem 0xsequence @0xsequence/design-system framer-motion @tanstack/react-query
# or
pnpm install @0xsequence/kit @0xsequence/waas wagmi ethers@6.13.0 viem 0xsequence @0xsequence/design-system framer-motion @tanstack/react-query
# or
yarn add @0xsequence/kit @0xsequence/waas wagmi ethers@6.13.0 viem 0xsequence @0xsequence/design-system framer-motion @tanstack/react-query
```

# Setting Up your Dapp

To utilize the core kit wrapper for connecting web3 wallets to your application, follow these steps:

<Note>
  Sequence Kit is built on top of wagmi, so for advanced configurations, sending
  transactions, calling contracts, etc., please refer to the [wagmi
  documentation](https://wagmi.sh/react/WagmiConfig).
</Note>

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a React Project with Vite">

We will start by creating a [React](https://react.dev/) project with [vite](https://vitejs.dev/):

```sh
npm create vite
# or
pnpm create vite
# or
yarn create vite
```

</Step>
<Step title="Create a Config">

Next, a configuration variable for Sequence Kit will need to be created as either a `waas` (meaning an [Embedded Wallet](/sdk/headless-wallet/quickstart)) or `universal` (meaning a [Universal Wallet](/sdk/web/wallet-types#universal-wallet)) wallet type.

For `waas`, first obtain a [WaaS Config Key from the Sequence Builder](/sdk/headless-wallet/), [Wallet Connect ID](https://cloud.reown.com/sign-in), and setup other [Login Provider configuration](/sdk/headless-wallet/#login-providers). For both wallet type options, [obtain and use a project access key](/sdk/api/access-key).

```typescript [config.ts]
import { createConfig } from "@0xsequence/kit";

export const config: any = createConfig("waas" /*or, 'universal'*/, {
  projectAccessKey: "<your-project-access-key>",
  chainIds: [1, 137],
  defaultChainId: 1,
  appName: "Demo Dapp",
  waasConfigKey: "<your-waas-config-key>", // for waas
  google: {
    clientId: "<your-google-client-id>",
  },
  walletConnect: {
    projectId: "<your-wallet-connect-project-id>",
  },
});
```

In order to customize further, [you can view additional configuration parameters.](/sdk/web/custom-configuration)
</Step>

<Step title="Setup Provider Component">

The configuration we created in [step 2](/sdk/web/getting-started#create-a-config) needs to be passed into the providers below in the `main.tsx`, as well as the inclusion of the Sequence Design System `styles.css` stylesheet:

```typescript [main.tsx]
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

import App from "./App";
import "@0xsequence/design-system/styles.css";
import { config } from "./config";

function Dapp() {
  return (
    <SequenceKit config={config}>
      <App />
    </SequenceKit>
  );
}

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Dapp />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

For web3 interactions, wagmi exposes a set of React hooks that make it convenient for common functions like sending transactions. Please check out our [Embedded Wallet boilerplate with Sequence Kit](https://github.com/0xsequence/kit-embedded-wallet-react-boilerplate) for more examples of interactions.
