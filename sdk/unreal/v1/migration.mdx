title: "Migrate from v1 to v2"
---

Sequence Unreal SDK v2 adds a lot structural improvements. Here is everything you need to know on how to migrate
from a previous 1.x.x version. If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to us.

### Config file

- Add a `DefaultChain` variable to your `SequenceConfig.ini` file.
- Remove the `RedirectUrl` value. If you have specified a custom value, call `SequenceSdk::SetRedirectUrl` to change it.
Alternatively, call the same function in the `SequenceSdkBP` subsystem for your Blueprint integration.

### Sign-In UI

We have removed support for the old Sign In Widget and its Pawn dependency.
If you have previously used the `BP_CustomSpectatorPawn`, `GM_Sequence` or any of the widgets, make sure to save your files in your project directory,
because the SDK no longer includes these files, and you will lose any changes you made.

- For an integrated Login UI, switch to our [Login Boilerplate](/sdk/unreal/bootstrap#login)
- Remove all references in your pawn that uses the `SequenceAuthenticator` and `SequenceBackendManager`.
- Make sure to exchange existing function calls to our Subsystems as mentioned in the next sections.

### Account Federation

We have removed separate functions for federation. Instead of calling `ConfirmEmailFederationWithCode` you call the
regular `ConfirmEmailLoginWithCode` node which will use the existing session to federate to.

### Blueprint Integration

Our Blueprint Subsystems have no separate event nodes anymore. Instead, they are included as function parameters.
You will see ‘OnSuccess’ and ‘OnFailure’ events in any async node such as ‘GetTokenBalances’. Please make sure to switch your existing nodes to the new structure.

Examples:
- Remove delegate assigners such as `Assign OnApiSendTransaction`
- Create event listeners directly from the `SendTransaction` node
- Switch Indexer calls like `GetTokenBalances` from `SequenceWalletBP` to `SequenceIndexerBP`

### C++ Integration

We renamed some of our classes for consistency. Please make sure to change your class references if you are using
any of the following.

- `UTransak` -> `USequencePay`
- `USequenceAuthenticator` -> `USequenceSessions`
- For Indexer calls: `USequenceWallet` -> `USequenceIndexer`
