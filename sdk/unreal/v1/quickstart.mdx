<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Unreal SDK">
Download and install the latest version of Sequence's Unreal SDK from [GitHub](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unreal/releases), or start a new project from scratch
by downloading our [Unreal Project Boilerplate](https://github.com/0xsequence/unreal-embedded-wallet-boilerplate).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the SDK">
Sign in and create a project on [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build).

Get your `Project Access Key` and `WaaS Configuration Key` from `Onboard > Embedded Wallet`,
and add them to your [Project's Sequence Config File](/sdk/unreal/configuration).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate E-Mail Login">
Start by establishing a wallet session using an email OTP. Execute the `Start Email Login Async` node to send a
one-time password to the specified email address. Then, use the `Confirm Email Login with Code Async` node with the
received password to complete the login.

Once youâ€™ve your first features integrated, you can continue with [additional login providers](/sdk/unreal/authentication)
such as Google, Apple, or PlayFab.

    <Step title="Test Sequence's Features">
Sequence's Unreal SDK includes a variety of Blueprints to help you quickly start your game.
Once everything is configured, you can create widgets to display an Inventory, Wallet View, or In-Game Store.
Checkout [how to integrate a Wallet View](/sdk/unreal/bootstrap_game#my-wallet-view) using just three Blueprint nodes to view and send funds.
