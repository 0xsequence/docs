## Using Sequence's Unreal Boilerplate

1. [Download our Boilerplate from GitHub](https://github.com/0xsequence/unreal-embedded-wallet-boilerplate)

2. Install the Unreal Engine version 5.4, if you don't have it already.

3. Open the Boilerplate Project and visit our [Unreal Boilerplate Guide](/guides/unreal-ew-guide)

## Using the latest GitHub Release

1. Download the latest release .zip file from [Release from GitHub.](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unreal/releases)

2. Navigate to the root directory of your Unreal project using a file management system or command line and create a `Plugins` folder, if you don't already have one.

3. Unzip the downloaded file and copy the `SequencePlugin` folder into your project's `Plugins` folder.

4. Launch your project, then allow it to update the UProject Settings.

5. To find the `SequencePlugin` content folder in your content drawer enable show plugin content: `Content Drawer > Settings > Show Plugin Content`

## Using Epic Games Marketplace

1. Visit the [Epic Games Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/sequence-embedded-wallets)

2. Click "Free" to add the plugin to your purchased Assets.

3. Click "Open in Launcher", and install the Plugin for your Engine version.

4. Open your project, navigate to `Edit > Plugins`, and enable the `SequencePlugin`

5. Restart the Unreal Editor so the changes can take effect

6. To find the `SequencePlugin` content folder in your content drawer enable show engine content: `Content Drawer > Settings > Show Engine Content`

## Upgrading to Unreal 5.4

Before updating, please backup any configuration data stored in `PluginConfig/Config.h` or `Config/Config.h`. Once backed up, delete the entire SequencePlugin directory. Replace it with the new updated version of the plugin.

If your project is currently on 5.2 or 5.3, then for this version you'll want to upgrade to 5.4.
1. Close the Unreal Editor and your your Code Editor
2. Right click on your Unreal Project file > "Switch Unreal Engine Version" (you may need to click "Show more options"), choose 5.4 and confirm
3. Open your code editor and rebuild your source code

As a way of future proofing we recommend installing Visual Studio 2022 in accordance with [these docs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/setting-up-visual-studio-development-environment-for-cplusplus-projects-in-unreal-engine) as Unreal 5.4 and onward will be dropping support for Visual Studio 2019.
