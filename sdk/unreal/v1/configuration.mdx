  <Step title="Private Dependency Modules">
    In your Project's Build.cs file ([where to find](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/where-are-build-cs-and-target-cs/302665)) please check the private Dependency module such that it includes "SequencePlugin":

```cpp
    public SequenceTest(ReadOnlyTargetRules Target) : base(Target)
    {
        PCHUsage = PCHUsageMode.UseExplicitOrSharedPCHs;
		PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "Core", "CoreUObject", "Engine", "InputCore" });
		PrivateDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "SequencePlugin" });
	}
```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a config file">
Navigate to `[YourProjectDirectory]/Config`, create a file named `SequenceConfig.ini`, and add the following content:

```
[/Script/Sequence.Config]

WaaSConfigKey = "Go to https://sequence.build/ under Onboard > Embedded Wallet"
ProjectAccessKey = "Go to https://sequence.build/ under Settings > API Keys"
GoogleClientID = "" 
AppleClientID = "" 
FacebookClientID = "" 
DiscordClientID = ""
PlayFabTitleID = ""
RedirectUrl = "https://api.sequence.app"
```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Don't forget to [configure your embedded wallet settings in the Builder](/solutions/builder/embedded-wallet/index)!
