Sequence's Unreal SDK includes a range of features to help you bootstrap your game.
You can create them as shown below or duplicate the `.uasset` files from the `Plugins/SequencePlugin Content/Samples/`
folder and customize them to fit your needs.

## Inventory

Create the `Sequence Inventory` widget to show all items owned by a user from any ERC1155 or ERC721 contract.
