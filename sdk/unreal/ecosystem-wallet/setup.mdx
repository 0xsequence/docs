### Configure your Ecosystem

First, download [v3 from the SDK's GitHub Releases](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unreal/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta)
to access Ecosystem Wallets. You can download one of the `.zip` files, depending on the Unreal Engine version you are using.

Create a `SequenceConfig.init` file by [following our Quickstart guide](/sdk/unreal/getting_started)

Next, fill in the required fields:

- **ProjectAccessKey:** Your Project Access Key from your [Builder project.](https://sequence.build/)
- **WalletAppUrl:** The URL of the Ecosystem you want to connect to. If you are unsure, use `https://v3.sequence-dev.app` as a default.

<Warning>
    If you used v1 or v2 of the Unreal SDK: `SequenceWallet` classes now refer to the Ecosystem Wallet. Use `SequenceEmbeddedWallet` instead, if you want to continue with your Embedded Wallet integration.
</Warning>

### Try our Built-In Demo

The Unreal SDK comes with a set of boilerplate widgets to get you started.
Make sure to enable `Enable Plugin Content` in your Content Browser's settings.
