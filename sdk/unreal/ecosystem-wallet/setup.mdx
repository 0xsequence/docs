### Configure your Ecosystem

First, create a `SequenceConfig.init` file by [following our Quickstart guide](/sdk/unreal/getting_started)

Next, fill in the required fields:

- **ProjectAccessKey:** Your Project Access Key from your [Builder project.](https://sequence.build/)
- **WalletAppUrl:** The URL of the Ecosystem you want to connect to. If you are unsure, use `https://v3.sequence-dev.app` as a default.

<Warning>
    If you used v1 or v2 of the Unreal SDK: `SequenceWallet` classes now refer to the Ecosystem Wallet. Use `SequenceEmbeddedWallet` instead, if you want to continue with your Embedded Wallet integration.
</Warning>

### Try our Built-In Demo

The Unreal SDK comes with a set of boilerplate widgets to get you started.
Make sure to enable `Enable Plugin Content` in your Content Browser's settings.
