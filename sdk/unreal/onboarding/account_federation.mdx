Visit our [Platform Requirements](/sdk/unreal/platforms) page for detailed information on setting up and ensuring
that the authentication methods you choose are properly configured in your Builder project.

## Federate Accounts

With Federated Accounts, you can associate multiple login methods with a single account and wallet.
If your user has signed in with as a Guest, you will definitely want to push them towards federating their
account in order to have persistent credentials with which they can access their Sequence Embedded Wallet in subsequent sessions.
While a user is authenticated with the Sequence API, you can add an additional login method by using the appropriate federate account call.
