<Steps>
    <Step title="Get Swap Price">
        Get a price for a given token pair. Alternatively, call `GetSwapPrices` to get a list of available options.
        Make sure that a DEX such as `UniSwap` has enough funds for your tokens.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Get Swap Quote">
        When you know the price for a given token pair, call `Get Swap Quote` for the same pair to get the required
        transaction data for your swap.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Send Transaction">
        Now that you have your transaction data from `Get Swap Quote`, you construct a transaction object and first
        add the `Approve Data` and then the `Transaction Data` to it. Make sure that the order of calling `Add Raw` is the same.
