<Steps>
    <Step title="List an Item on your Marketplace">
        Let's start by listing one of your items. A `Listing` is the state of an item on your Marketplace that
        other players are allowed to purchase. The `Wallet Address` should be your client's address and it needs to
        own the specified amount of tokens.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Query Listings">
        Now that we have our first item listed, let's query our listings, starting with the lowest priced listing first.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Pick & Buy Order">
        Take one of the returned orders from the `OnSuccess` event node and generate a transaction to purchase the item.
        This will only give you the transaction data. Follow the next step on how to send the transaction.

        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Convert Steps to a Transaction">
        When generating a transaction with the `SequenceCheckout` module, you receive an array of `Steps` which you need
        to convert to a Transactions object. This is what you need to use when sending the transaction.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Next Steps">
        Now that you know how to query- and buy listings, you can take a further look into [creating offers](/sdk/unreal/monetization/checkout#generate-offer-transaction). An `Offer` is
        the state of an item which other players can sell to you. Additionally, you also have the ability to [cancel any listing or
        offer.](/sdk/unreal/monetization/checkout#generate-cancel-transaction)
    </Step>
