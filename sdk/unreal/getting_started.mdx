<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Unreal SDK">
      Download the SDK from the [Epic Games Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/sequence-embedded-wallets)

      Alternatively, you have the following options:
      1) [GitHub Release](sdk/unreal/installation#using-the-latest-github-release): Manual installation. This release is always up to date.
      2) [Project Boilerplate](https://github.com/0xsequence/unreal-embedded-wallet-boilerplate): Start a project from scratch.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the SDK">
        Create a project on [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build) and download your config file as shown below.

  </Step>
    <Step>
        In your Project's `Build.cs` file ([where to find](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/where-are-build-cs-and-target-cs/302665)) please check the private Dependency module such that it includes "SequencePlugin":

        ```cpp
        public SequenceTest(ReadOnlyTargetRules Target) : base(Target)
        {
            PCHUsage = PCHUsageMode.UseExplicitOrSharedPCHs;
            PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "Core", "CoreUObject", "Engine", "InputCore" });
            PrivateDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "SequencePlugin" });
        }
        ```
    </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate E-Mail Login">
Start by establishing a wallet session using an email OTP. Execute the `Start Email Login Async` node to send a
one-time password to the specified email address. Then, use the `Confirm Email Login with Code Async` node with the
received password to complete the login.

Once youâ€™ve your first features integrated, you can continue with [additional login providers](/sdk/unreal/authentication)
such as Google, Apple, or PlayFab.

    <Step title="Test Sequence's Features">
Sequence's Unreal SDK includes a variety of Boilerplates to help you quickly start your game.
Once everything is configured, you can create widgets to display an Inventory, Wallet View, or In-Game Store.
Checkout [how to integrate a Wallet View](/sdk/unreal/bootstrap_game#my-wallet-view) using just three Blueprint nodes to view and send funds.
