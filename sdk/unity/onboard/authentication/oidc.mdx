title: OIDC - Social Sign In
---

Our SDK supports Social Sign In using [OIDC](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) with the [implicit flow](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/oidc-conformant-authentication/oidc-adoption-implicit-flow).

Currently supported OIDC providers include:
- Google -> [Builder Setup](/solutions/builder/embedded-wallet/google-configuration)
- Apple -> [Builder Setup](/solutions/builder/embedded-wallet/apple-configuration)

<Warning>Stop! Have you configured your OIDC providers in the Builder using the instructions linked above? Have you added your client id(s) to the `SequenceConfig` scriptable object in your Resources folder?</Warning>

Once the user successfully signs in, an idToken is returned via deep link to the application.
In order to enable deep linking, we must register a custom URL scheme for our application. There are some platform specific requirements to set this up.

### Editor

For social sign in to work in the editor, you will need to deploy a simple server on your local machine. We provide a sample implementation [here](https://gist.github.com/BellringerQuinn/d012cd29eb9e756fe3555d4d03b001b2).

To deploy this sample server, please perform the following.

1. Download and install Go: https://go.dev/dl/
2. Open a terminal/command prompt and verify your installation by typing

```
go version
```

3. Create a directory for your go project and a main.go file

```
mkdir myUnityServer
cd myUnityServer
touch main.go
```

4. Copy + paste the [gist](https://gist.github.com/BellringerQuinn/d012cd29eb9e756fe3555d4d03b001b2) into the main.go
5. Initialize the project by creating a go module

```
go mod init myUnityServer
```

6. Run the server

```
go run main.go
```

7. You should see `Server listening on port 8080` printed to your terminal/command prompt

If you choose to deploy the server to somewhere else (a different port, a public server, etc.), you'll want to change the `OpenIdAuthenticator.RedirectUrl` in your code before initiating the sign in process

```csharp
OpenIdAuthenticator.InjectRedirectUrl("the url for your deployed server");
```

Note: you'll want to use a web client for your social sign in provider with `http://localhost:8080/` (or your server url) whitelisted as a redirect url under `Standalone Platforms` in `SequenceConfig`

### iOS

#### Sign in with Apple

This SDK supports native Sign in with Apple via the popular [`apple-signin-unity` package](https://github.com/lupidan/apple-signin-unity). This [requires the `Sign in with Apple` capability in XCode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-sign-in-with-apple#Add-the-Sign-in-with-Apple-capability-to-your-app) in order to function. Provided you have [imported the `Setup` scripts via Package Manager > Samples](https://docs.sequence.xyz/sdk/unity/installation#package-manager---recommended) and/or have `SignInWithApplePostprocessor.cs` under an `Editor` subfolder, this capability will be added to your XCode builds automatically.

Please be aware that this capability is not supported by `Personal Teams`.

#### Other Social Platforms

All other social platforms are supported by default, just be sure to add your client IDs in `SequenceConfig`.

### MacOS

1. Open the Windows/Mac/Linux Player Settings window (menu: Edit > Project Settings > Player Settings, then select Windows/Mac/Linux).
2. Select `Other Settings`, then scroll down to `Mac Configuration`.
3. Expand the `Supported URL schemes` section, and add 1 to the size.
4. In the new `Element N` field, enter the URL scheme you've configured in `SequenceConfig`.

### PC

No additional steps required.

<Tip>When configuring your social sign in *web client* credentials with Google (for example) for desktop platforms (and Android), you'll want to whitelist https://api.sequence.app/oauth/callback as "Authorized redirect URIs"</Tip>

### Android

1. In the Project window, browse to `Assets > Plugins > Android`.

a) Note: in Unity versions 2021.2 and up this path doesn't exist by default. Please navigate to `Edit > Project Settings > Player` and under the Android Publishing Settings, enable `Custom Main Manifest` in the Build section. See https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/deep-linking-android.html for more info.

2. If it doesn't already exist, create a new file and name it `AndroidManifest.xml`.
3. Paste the following XML into the file, or, if you already have one, add the new keys from this XML to it.
4. Make sure to replace 'sdk-powered-by-sequence' with the Url Scheme you set in `SequenceConfig`

```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <manifest
     xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
     xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
   >
     <application>
       <activity
         android:name="com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity"
         android:theme="@style/UnityThemeSelector"
       >
         <intent-filter>
           <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
           <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
         </intent-filter>
         <intent-filter>
           <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
           <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
           <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
           <data android:scheme="sdk-powered-by-sequence"/> <!-- substitute 'sdk-powered-by-sequence' with the Url Scheme you set in `SequenceConfig` -->
         </intent-filter>
       </activity>
     </application>
   </manifest>
```

b) Note: Unity 2022 versions prior to `2022.3.7f1` and 2023 versions prior to `2023.1.7f1`, `2023.2.0b3`, or `2023.3.0a1` contain a bug with Android deep-linking. Please use this XML instead.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest
        xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
>
    <application>
        <activity
                android:name="com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity"
                android:theme="@style/UnityThemeSelector"
                android:exported="true">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
            </intent-filter>
            <meta-data android:name="unityplayer.UnityActivity" android:value="true" />
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
                <data android:scheme="sdk-powered-by-sequence"/> <!-- substitute 'sdk-powered-by-sequence' with the Url Scheme you set in `SequenceConfig` -->
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

i.e. add `<meta-data android:name="unityplayer.UnityActivity" android:value="true" />` after your first `intent-filter`. Please see https://forum.unity.com/threads/deep-linking-in-unity-2022-the-app-is-restarted.1447300/ for more info.

<Tip>If you're working with Unity 6, you may need to replace `UnityPlayerActivity` in your AndroidManifest with `UnityPlayerGameActivity`! You may also need to replace your `android:theme`; we've found "@style/BaseUnityGameActivityTheme" works well in our testing.</Tip>

### Web

Social sign in on Web platforms uses React via the [WebGLTemplate](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-templates.html) found under `WebGLTemplates/SequenceReact`. This has been validated on WebGL and WebGPU. To learn how to enable WebGPU in Unity, please see [this forum post](https://forum.unity.com/threads/early-access-to-the-new-webgpu-backend-in-unity-2023-3.1516621/).


Please note that Google is the only OIDC provider currently supported on Web platforms by our default `SequenceReact` WebGLTemplate; however, you are welcome to expand upon it to add support for the other OIDC providers supported by our API.


#### One-time setup

Drag this `WebGLTemplates` folder under `Assets` (or just drag the `SequenceReact` template into your existing `WebGLTemplates` folder is you already have one) such that you have `Assets/WebGLTemplates/SequenceReact`.

<Warning>It is very important that your `WebGLTemplates` are at `Assets/WebGLTemplates`. Much like the `Plugins` folder, if they aren't in this exact location, Unity will not pick them up!</Warning>

Once you've added the `SequenceReact` template, you'll want to restart the editor so that Unity picks up your newly added template.

From here, you can select the template under `Project Settings > Player Settings > Resolution and Presentation`.

#### Building

After the one time setup, when you build your Unity project on Web platforms it will be built as part of a React project.

1. Open up a command line at the root of your new build
2. [Install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) if you don't already have it
3. `pnpm install` to install dependancies
4. `pnpm dev` to run the project on your localhost (defaulting to port 4444 - configurable in `SequenceReact/package.json`)
5. Open http://localhost:4444

<Warning>When building your WebGL app, if you are using any `Compression Format` (e.g. Gzip or Brotli), it is recommended to enable `Decompression Fallback` under `Player Settings > Publishing Settings`. Learn more about WebGL deployment here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-deploying.html</Warning>

<Tip>When configuring your social sign in credentials with Google (for example), you'll want to whitelist http://localhost:4444 and your game's eventual hosted URL as "Authorized Javascript origins"</Tip>

<Tip>Don't forget to subscribe to the `SequenceWallet.OnWalletCreated` event to receive your newly created wallet!</Tip>
