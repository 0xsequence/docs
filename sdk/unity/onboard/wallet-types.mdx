# Wallet Types

The Sequence Unity SDK supports two wallet types:

## Embedded Wallet

The [Embedded Wallet](/sdk/headless-wallet) is a wallet that is embedded into your game. It is a non-custodial wallet that is controlled by the user. The user can sign transactions and messages with this wallet. The Embedded Wallet is the recommended wallet type for most games.

## Universal Wallet

The [Universal Wallet](/sdk/typescript/guides/connect-wallet) is a wallet that can connect to any external wallet. It is a non-custodial wallet that is controlled by the user. The user can sign transactions and messages with this wallet. The Universal Wallet is recommended for games that want to support external wallets.
