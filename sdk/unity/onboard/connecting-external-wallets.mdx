# Connecting External Wallets

While the majority of user interactions will happen using the embedded wallet, some of your users may have existing wallets they wish to connect with your games. This allows you to validate a user holds a token(s) without requiring them to transfer it to their embedded wallet.

You can connect an external wallet with an embedded wallet via a web interface. This gives you read-only access to any external wallet you linked to your Embedded Wallet.

First, you'll want to configure a web app to facilitate this connection. Please [read this guide](/solutions/wallets/developers/embedded-wallet/wallet-linking) and come back once you've configured your web app.

Now that you've configured your web app, you can link players to your url. Once they sign in on your web app, they are free to link their EOA wallets.

### Link Users to your Web App

```csharp
Application.OpenURL("https://your-web-app.io/");
```

Once a wallet is linked, you can simply call the following Unity APIs to get all linked wallets or unlink a wallet.

### Get Linked Wallets

``` csharp
EOAWalletLinker linker = new EOAWalletLinker(wallet, Chain.Polygon);
LinkedWalletData[] wallets = await linker.GetLinkedWallets();
```

### Unlink Wallet

```csharp
EOAWalletLinker linker = new EOAWalletLinker(wallet, Chain.Polygon);
bool result = await linker.UnlinkWallet("0xabc...");
```
