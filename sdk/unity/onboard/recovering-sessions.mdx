title: Secure Session Recovery
description: The SDK offers the option to store session wallet information securely on select platforms using native secure storage.

# Recovering Sessions 

By default, the SDK will require users to sign in everytime the app is closed completely. This is because, by default, we do not write the session wallet information (e.g. private keys) to any form of persistent storage for user security.

However, on select platforms, we have integrated with the platform's native secure storage offering.

If you enable `StoreSessionPrivateKeyInSecureStorage` in your `SequenceConfig` ScriptableObject, we will automatically store the session wallet information for you (on supported platforms) and expose the ability to attempt to recover the session in `SequenceLogin`. The default `LoginPanel` will automatically handle the UI flow for this as well (see [Authentication](/sdk/unity/onboard/authentication/intro)). If the platform is not supported, this flag will have no effect.

See below the supported platforms and to learn about the platform's secure storage solution - it is important to understand the basics of how these systems work and think carefully about the security implications of storing private keys (or any secret for that matter) in persistent storage.

## iOS 

On iOS, we leverage the [iOS Keychain](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services?language=objc).

## MacOS 

On MacOS, we leverage the [MacOS Keychain](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services?language=objc).

## Windows

On Windows PCs, we leverage the [Crypto: Next Generation - Data Protection API (CNG DPAPI)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccng/cng-dpapi)

## Web 

On Web builds, we leverage [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) via [PlayerPrefs](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PlayerPrefs.html).

## Android 

On Android builds, we leverage the [Android Keystore](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/keystore).

The first step is to import the `AndroidKeyBridge.java` plugin into your Assets folder. This is most easily done via Samples in the package manager - simply import the sample titled `Android Secure Storage`.

Our Keystore plugin for Unity (included in the SDK) requires a Custom Main Gradle Template. Please navigate to your Project Settings, then under `Player > Publishing Settings` enable `Custom Main Gradle Template`. This will create a file `Assets/Plugins/Android/mainTemplate.gradle` (or similar, the editor will show you the path) if you don't have one already. Here is an example `mainTemplate.gradle` file; please copy/paste this (or incorporate into your existing file).

```
apply plugin: 'com.android.library'
**APPLY_PLUGINS**

dependencies {
    implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
    implementation 'androidx.security:security-crypto:1.1.0-alpha03'

**DEPS**}

android {
    compileSdkVersion **APIVERSION**
    buildToolsVersion '**BUILDTOOLS**'

    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }

    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion **MINSDKVERSION**
        targetSdkVersion **TARGETSDKVERSION**
        ndk {
            abiFilters **ABIFILTERS**
        }
        versionCode **VERSIONCODE**
        versionName '**VERSIONNAME**'
        consumerProguardFiles 'proguard-unity.txt'**USER_PROGUARD**
    }

    lintOptions {
        abortOnError false
    }

    aaptOptions {
        noCompress = **BUILTIN_NOCOMPRESS** + unityStreamingAssets.tokenize(', ')
        ignoreAssetsPattern = "!.svn:!.git:!.ds_store:!*.scc:.*:!CVS:!thumbs.db:!picasa.ini:!*~"
    }**PACKAGING_OPTIONS**
}**REPOSITORIES**
**IL_CPP_BUILD_SETUP**
**SOURCE_BUILD_SETUP**
**EXTERNAL_SOURCES**
```

Our Keystore plugin also requires a Custom Gradle Properties Template. Again, navigate to your Project Settings, then under `Player > Publishing Settings` enable `Custom Gradle Properties Template`. This will create a file `Assets/Plugins/Android/gradleTemplate.properties` (or similar, the editor will show you the path) if you don't have one already. Here is an example `gradleTemplate.properties` file; please copy/paste this (or incorporate into your existing file).

```
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx**JVM_HEAP_SIZE**M
org.gradle.parallel=true
android.enableJetifier=true
android.useAndroidX=true
unityStreamingAssets=**STREAMING_ASSETS**
**ADDITIONAL_PROPERTIES**

android.enableR8=**MINIFY_WITH_R_EIGHT**
```

## Editor

In the editor, we use PlayerPrefs for private key storage. You will also need to enable 'EditorStoreSessionPrivateKeyInSecureStorage' in SequenceConfig in order to use secure storage and recover sessions from within the editor. This separate flag makes it easier for you to test both flows without modifying the behaviour of your builds. Secure storage in the editor is for development purposes only and should not be considered secure for long-term storage.
