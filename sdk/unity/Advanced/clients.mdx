description: Use SequenceEthereum to create a Client and utilize our Node Gateway service for RPC requests.
---

In the context of SequenceEthereum, a `Client` is defined by the [`IEthClient` interface](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unity/blob/master/Assets/SequenceSDK/Ethereum/Provider/IEthClient.cs).

Creating a client requires a `Chain`. This will use our highly available and responsive Node Gateway service for your RPC requests; accessed using the API key from the Builder you've provided in your `SequenceConfig` scriptable object. If you prefer to use your own RPC URL, you can create a `SequenceEthClient` using a URL string as a parameter instead.

You can create a client using this snippet:

```csharp
IEthClient client = new SequenceEthClient(Chain.Polygon);
```

## Methods

As your connection point to Ethereum nodes, there are a number of methods that can be performed by a client, these can be found in the `IEthClient` interface and are implemented by `SequenceEthClient`.

<Note>
With the exception of BalanceAt (potentially), most users will not need to make use of these methods, but we have included them in our documentation for completeness. 
</Note>

### BalanceAt

Used to get the gas currency balance of a given wallet at a given blockNumber (in hexadecimal format provided as a string)

```csharp
BigIntegar balance = await client.BalanceAt(wallet.GetAddress()); // By default, if no blockNumber string is provided, check the latest block
BigIntegar balance = await client.BalanceAt(wallet.GetAddress(), blockNumber);
```

<Note>
There are two special values for blockNumber. "earliest" will get the balance at the earliest block on the chain. "latest" will get the balance at the latest block on the chain and is the default parameter when none is provided. Otherwise, you'll want to provide the blockNumber string in hexadecimal format.
</Note>

<Warning>
<b><u>Unless you <i>really</i> want to get into the weeds with how things work, it is HIGHLY recommended to move on to the next page of the documentation at this point</u></b>
</Warning>

### BlockByNumber

Used to get the `Block` with a specific block number.

```csharp
Block block = await client.BlockByNumber(blockNumber);
```

<Note>
As above, blockNumber should be in hexadecimal format or special values "ealiest" and "latest"
</Note>

### BlockByHash

Used to get the `Block` by a specified block hash (string)

```csharp
Block block = await client.BlockByHash(blockHash);
```

### BlockNumber

Used to get the most recent block number in hexadecimal format

```csharp
string blockNumber = await client.BlockNumber();
```

### BlockRange 

Used to get a `List<Block>` from the blocks in a range specified by blockNumbers

```csharp
List<Block> blockRange = await client.BlockRange(startingBlockNumber, endingBlockNumber);
```

<Note>
As above, blockNumber should be in hexadecimal format or special values "ealiest" and "latest"
</Note>

### ChainID

Used to get the chain id in hexadecimal format for the chain the client is connected to 

```csharp
string chainId = await client.ChainID();
```

### CodeAt

Used to get the bytecode for a smart contract at a given address in hexadecimal format at a specified blockNumber

```csharp
string code = await client.CodeAt(contractAddress, blockNumber);
```

<Note>
As above, blockNumber should be in hexadecimal format or special values "ealiest" and "latest"
</Note>

### EstimateGas

Given a `TransactionCall` estimate the amount of gas required for the transaction

```csharp
BigIntegar gas = await client.EstimateGas(transactionCall);
```

### FeeHistory

Get a `FeeHistoryResult` for gas fees paid blockCount blocks since newestBlock (blockNumber)

```csharp
FeeHistoryResult feeHistory = await client.FeeHistory(blockCount, newestBlock, new int[] { });
```

<Note>
As above, blockNumber should be in hexadecimal format or special values "ealiest" and "latest"
</Note>

### NetworkId

Used to get the chain id in integer format (as string) for the chain the client is connected to 

```csharp
string networkId = await client.NetworkId();
```

### NonceAt

Used to get the recommended nonce for a given `Address` at a given blockNumber (defaults to "latest")

```csharp
BigInteger nonce = await client.NonceAt(wallet.GetAddress()); // Nonce at latest
BigIntegar nonce = await client.NonceAt(wallet.GetAddress(), blockNumber);
```

<Note>
As above, blockNumber should be in hexadecimal format or special values "ealiest" and "latest"
</Note>

### SendRawTransaction

Given a signed transaction string, submit the transaction to the network and return a transaction hash

```csharp
string transactionHash = await client.SendRawTransaction(signedTransactionString);
```

### SuggestGasPrice

Used to get a suggested gas price

```csharp
BigIntegar gasPrice = await client.SuggestGasPrice();
```

### SuggestGasTipCap

Used to get the max suggested priority fee for gas

```csharp
BigIntegar gasTipCap = await client.SuggestGasTipCap();
```

### TransactionByHash

Used to get a `Transaction` by transaction hash

```csharp
Transaction transaction = await client.TransactionByHash(transactionHash);
```

### TransactionCount

Used to get the number of transactions in a block by block hash 

```csharp
BigIntegar transactionCount = await client.TransactionCount(blockHash);
```

### WaitForTransactionReceipt

Provide a transaction hash in order to wait for and return the `TransactionReceipt`

```csharp
TransactionReceipt receipt = await client.WaitForTransactionReceipt(transactionHash);
```
