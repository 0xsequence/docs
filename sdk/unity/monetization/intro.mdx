The Sequence Unity SDK provides a means for monetizing your players. This are mainly facilitated by:

1. [Primary ERC721/1155 collectible sales](/sdk/unity/monetization/primary-sales/intro)
2. [Secondary ERC721/1155 collectible sales](/sdk/unity/monetization/secondary-sales/intro), peer to peer

Primary Sales are analogous to traditional In-App Purchases; you, the game developer, are selling + minting new collectibles directly to your players.

Secondary Sales Marketplaces are a bit more unique. This involves players buying/selling collectibles between one another with you, the game developer, earning a % of the sellers' sale price in fees.

Thanks to [Sequence Pay](/solutions/payments/overview), there are a number of ways via which a player can pay for their collectibles:

1. Pay with crypto 
2. [Smart Swap](/sdk/web/guides/smart-swaps) and pay with crypto
3. Transfer funds to wallet with QR code 
4. [Onboard funds with credit card](/sdk/unity/monetization/onboard-user-funds)
5. Checkout with credit card (purchasing the collectible(s) with credit card directly)

## Installation

The V4 version of our SDK is currently in beta and maintained on a separate branch. We are eagerly looking for feedback on this new major update for the SDK, so please get in touch with us!

Please [install via Package Manager with Git URL](/sdk/unity/installation#or-using-package-manager-ui):

`https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unity.git?path=/Packages/Sequence-Unity#v4-beta`

If you already have the Sequence Unity SDK installed in your project, you will likely need to remove it.

## Understanding the Flow 

At a high level, monetization via collectible sales, whether primary or secondary sales, involves three steps:

1. Reading the marketplace/sales contract, determining what is for sale, and displaying the appropriate info the user.
2. The user selects which collectible they wish the purchase (and how many instances of it) using some form of UI.
3. The user "checks out" and purchases their collectible using one of the methods listed above.
