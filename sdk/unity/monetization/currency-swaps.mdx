title: Currency Swaps
---

Swapping between different ERC20/native token currencies on a given Chain is made easy by Sequence's Smart Swap API.

Please make sure that your token pair has enough liquidity on a supported exchange such as UniSwap.

## GetSwapPrice

This method can be used to get the current `SwapPrice` for a given buyCurrency and buyAmount using a given sellCurrency.

```
ISwap swapper = new CurrencySwap(_chain);
SwapPrice swapPrice = await swapper.GetSwapPrice(buyCurrencyTokenAddress, usdcAddress, "1000"); // where USDC is an example sell currency
```
You can optionally subscribe to the `OnSwapPriceReturn` and `OnSwapPriceError` events in order to handle the response elsewhere.

You can optionally provide a maximum allowable slippagePercentage.

## GetSwapPrices

This method is similar to `GetSwapPrice`, it can be used to get the current `SwapPrice` for a given buyCurrency and buyAmount. Except, instead of providing a sellCurrency, you instead provide the user's wallet address.

This method will detect the eligible currencies (ERC20s or native tokens) that can be swapped for buyAmount of the buyCurrency and will return a `SwapPrice[]`.

```
ISwap swapper = new CurrencySwap(_chain);
SwapPrice[] swapPrices = await swapper.GetSwapPrices(userWalletAddress, buyCurrencyTokenAddress, "1000");
```
You can optionally subscribe to the `OnSwapPricesReturn` and `OnSwapPricesError` events in order to handle the response elsewhere.

You can optionally provide a maximum allowable slippagePercentage.

## GetSwapQuote

This method is used to get an executable `SwapQuote` for a given userWallet address to buy buyAmount of buyCurrency using sellCurrency.

```
ISwap swapper = new CurrencySwap(_chain);
SwapQuote quote = await swapper.GetSwapQuote(userWalletAddress, buyCurrencyTokenAddess, usdcAddress, "1000", true); // where USDC is an example sell currency
```

Once you've obtained a `SwapQuote`, you can transform it into a `Transaction[]` that can be submitted via your EmbeddedWallet to execute the swap.

```
Transaction[] swapTransactions = quote.AsTransactionArray();

_wallet.SendTransaction(_chain, swapTransactions);
```

If `includeApprove = true` the SwapQuote response will also include the information required to create the required spend approval transaction(s). These will also be added to the `Transaction[]` created above via `SwapQuote.AsTransactionArray()`. As usual, with our embedded smart contract wallets, all of these transactions can be submitted at once in a bundle; significantly improving the UX for your players who would usually need to make separate transactions to approve and swap.
