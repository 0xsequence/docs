title: Accepting Offers
---

If there are outstanding offers, users can be enabled to "accept" offers, selling their collectible(s) to the user who made the offer.

You can read the outstanding offers using `ListCollectibleOffersWithHighestPricedOfferFirst`:

```csharp
IMarketplaceReader reader = new MarketplaceReader(chain);
ListCollectibleListingsReturn collectiblesResponse = await reader.ListCollectibleOffersWithHighestPricedOfferFirst(collectibleContractAddress, optionalCollectiblesFilter);
```

or, if you want to get all the sellable offers for your user, you can use the `ListAllSellableOffers` helper method (or just provide the `CollectiblesFilter` below):

```csharp
IMarketplaceReader reader = new MarketplaceReader(chain);
CollectibleOrder[] sellableOffers = await reader.ListAllSellableOffers(userAddress, collectionContractAddress, optionalCollectiblesFilter);
```
This will append the user's address (seller's address) to the `inAccounts` and `ordersNotCreatedBy` filters in the CollectiblesFilter object. This method will also handle pagination for you - continually making requests until there are no more pages - so use it with caution if you expect a large number of offers. If you do expect a large number of offers, simply use `ListCollectibleOffersWithHighestPricedOfferFirst` and provide the described `CollectiblesFilter`.

Once the user has selected the offer they wish to accept and the amount of collectible instances they want to sell, you can fill the offer/sell the collectible(s):

```csharp
ICheckout checkout = new Checkout(_wallet, _chain);
Step[] steps = await checkout.GenerateSellTransaction(selectedOrders, amount);
TransactionReturn result = await steps.SubmitAsTransactions(_wallet, _chain);
if (result is SuccessfulTransactionReturn successTransaction) {
    // Handle success case
}else {
    // Handle fail case
}
```
