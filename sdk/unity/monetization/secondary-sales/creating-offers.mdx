title: Creating Offers
---

When building your marketplace, you may want to give your users the opportunity to place offers to buy collectibles. You'll likely want to display a UI showcasing the collectibles that are sellable on your marketplace.

Once your user has selected the collectible, amount, and price they'd like to offer for purchase, you'll want to create the offer.

```
ICheckout checkout = new Checkout(_wallet, _chain);
Step[] steps = await checkout.GenerateOfferTransaction(collectionContractAddress, tokenId, amount, ContractType.ERC1155, currencyTokenAddress, pricePerTokenInstance, expiryDateTime);
TransactionReturn result = await steps.SubmitAsTransactions(_wallet, _chain);
if (result is SuccessfulTransactionReturn successTransaction) {
    // Handle success case
}else {
    // Handle fail case
}
```


You can jumpstart the process by using our Boilerplate Factory

For wallet token balances

```csharp
            BoilerplateFactory.OpenCreateOfferPanel(Transform parent, ICheckout checkout, TokenBalance item, Action onClose = null)
```

For marketplace collectible orders

```csharp
            BoilerplateFactory. OpenCreateOfferPanel(Transform parent,ICheckout checkout, CollectibleOrder item, Action onClose = null)
```
