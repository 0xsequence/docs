# Summary

Sequence Sidekick enables seamless interaction with blockchain functionality directly within the Unity Editor — no need to run the game or leave the Unity environment. 

Test blockchain features with wallets, contracts, and more — all from within Unity. For advanced usage and API details, check the full [Sequence Sidekick documentation](https://docs.sequence.xyz/solutions/sidekick/overview).

## Prerequisites

Before using the Unity integration, you need to install and configure the Sequence Sidekick service on your system. Follow the official guide here:

**[Sequence Sidekick Setup Guide](https://docs.sequence.xyz/solutions/sidekick/overview)**

This will walk you through downloading and launching Sidekick.

## Unity Setup Instructions

Once Sidekick is set up, follow these steps to integrate it with Unity:

### 1. Create a SidekickConfig ScriptableObject

In the Unity Editor:

- Open the `Assets > Create > Sequence > SidekickConfig` menu.
- Create a new `SidekickConfig` asset.
- In the Inspector, set the path to your local Sidekick directory.

This path tells the Unity integration how to launch the Sidekick service from the editor.

### 2. Use the SequenceDev Tab

After configuring the Sidekick path:

- Open the `SequenceDev` tab in the Unity Editor toolbar.
- You can **Start** and **Stop** the Sidekick service directly from here.

This gives you full control of the Sidekick runtime within the Unity environment.

### 3. Add SidekickEditorController to Your Scene

To begin interacting with the blockchain:

- Add the `SidekickEditorController` script into any scene.
- This component enables communication between Unity and the Sidekick backend.

> You do **not** need to enter Play mode to use Sidekick features.
