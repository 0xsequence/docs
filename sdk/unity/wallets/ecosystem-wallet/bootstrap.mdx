Sequence's Unity SDK includes a range of features to help you bootstrap your game.
Import our Boilerplates from the `Demo` samples in the Package Manager UI.
Create them using the `BoilerplateFactory` as shown below. Feel free to adjust the UI and logic inside the samples to fit your needs.

Ensure that your codebase has access to the `Sequence.Boilerplates.asmdef` assembly.

Checkout the `BoilerplateController.cs` for more integration examples.

## Login

Create the `SequenceLoginWindow` prefab to authenticate users as a Guest, with Email OTP, Google- or Apple Sign In.

[Checkout the Authentication section](/sdk/unity/onboard/authentication/intro) for more details on how to configure
your project for each login option.
