### Configure your Ecosystem

First, download [v5 from the SDK's GitHub Releases](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unity/releases/tag/v5-beta)
to access Ecosystem Wallets. You can download it as a `.unitypackage` file and simply add it to your Unity project.

Create a SequenceConfig file by [following our Quickstart guide](/sdk/unity/quickstart) or simply create a new file in Unity via `Create` > `Sequence` > `SequenceConfig`

Next, fill in the required fields:

- **Builder API Key:** Your Project Access Key from your [Builder project.](https://sequence.build/)
- **Wallet App Url:** The URL of the Ecosystem you want to connect to. If you are unsure, use `https://v3.sequence-dev.app` as a default.

### Try our Built-In Demo

Import the `Ecosystem Wallet Demo` sample from Unity's Package Manager. Additionally, checkout our boilerplate
script `SequenceEcosystemWalletWindow` for integration details.
