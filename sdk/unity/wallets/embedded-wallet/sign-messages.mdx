title: Sign Messages

Signing a message is an [asynchronous Task](https://medium.com/@sonusprocks/async-await-in-c-unity-explained-in-easy-words-571ebb6a9369). You can use `await` when calling `WaaSWallet.SignMessage` from within an async Task if you wish to obtain the `SignMessageReturn` object directly. Or, you can take the recommended approach which is to setup a handler function for the `WaaSWallet.OnSignMessageComplete` event and call the `WaaSWallet.SignMessage` method from anywhere (without await). For example:
```csharp
public void OnSignMessageCompleteHandler(string signature) {
    // Do something
}

public void OnWalletCreatedHander(SequenceWallet wallet) {
    wallet.OnSignMessageComplete += OnSignMessageCompleteHandler;
}
```

```csharp
_wallet.SignMessage(Chain.Polygon, "Message to sign");
```
