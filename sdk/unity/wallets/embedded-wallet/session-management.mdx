Once you've authenticated your user with the Sequence APIs and established a session, there are a number of methods available to you to manage the session.

## List Sessions

Use the `ListSessions` method to find all active sessions associated with this user/wallet.

## Drop Session

If you wish to drop/end a session, you can use the `DropSession` method and provide the session id you wish to drop.

## Drop This Session

The `DropThisSession` method can be use if you wish to drop/end the current session. In other words, if you wish to log the user out.

## Get Account List 

If you wish to fetch the `Account`s associated with the user's wallet, you can use the `GetAccountList` method.

## Get Id Token

If you wish to retrieve an id token JWT from the Sequence APIs to validate the authentication on your backend, you can use the `GetIdToken` method and optionally provide a nonce.
