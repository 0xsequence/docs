Once you've authenticated your user with the Sequence APIs and established a session, there are a number of methods available to you to manage the session.

## Setup

If you enable `StoreSessionPrivateKeyInSecureStorage` in your `SequenceConfig` ScriptableObject, we will automatically store the session wallet information for you (on supported platforms) and expose the ability to attempt to recover the session in `SequenceLogin`. The default `SequenceLoginWindow` will automatically handle the UI flow for this as well (see [Authentication](/sdk/unity/wallets/embedded-wallet/onboard/authentication/intro)). If the platform is not supported, this flag will have no effect.

Read our [Recovering Sessions](/sdk/unity/advanced/recovering-sessions) page for more details on what platforms tools we use to securely store player details.

## Integration

You have two options to recover a wallet from storage. First is to use the `EmbeddedWalletAdapter` class. If this call succeeds, the `EmbeddedWalletAdapter` contains the Wallet instance.

```csharp
bool recovered = await EmbeddedWalletAdapter.GetInstance().TryRecoverWalletFromStorage();
```

Otherwise, use the underlying `SequenceLogin` class.

```csharp
(bool storageEnabled, IWallet wallet) = await SequenceLogin.GetInstance().TryToRestoreSessionAsync();
```

In both cases, you can listen to the `SequenceWallet.OnWalletCreated` event whenever a wallet was recovered from storage or created during the sign-in process.
