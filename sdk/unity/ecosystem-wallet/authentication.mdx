Start with an implicit session which is restricted to contracts built by Sequence.
Alternatively, you can choose to add a `SessionPermissions` object to each Sign In call, if you want to connect to an
explicit session directly.

### Sign In with Email

```csharp
string email = "your.mail@example.com";
SequenceSessionWallet session = await connect.SignInWithEmail(email);
```

### Sign In with Google

```csharp
SequenceSessionWallet session = await connect.SignInWithGoogle();
```

### Sign In with Apple

```csharp
SequenceSessionWallet session = await connect.SignInWithApple();
```

### Sign In with Passkey

```csharp
SequenceSessionWallet session = await connect.SignInWithPasskey();
```

### Sign In with Mnemonic

```csharp
SequenceSessionWallet session = await connect.SignInWithMnemonic();
```

### Set Chain

```csharp
connect.SetChain(Chain.TestnetArbitrumSepolia);
```
