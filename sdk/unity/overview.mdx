# Introduction

The Sequence Unity Embedded Wallet SDK provides full Sequence [Embedded Wallet](/sdk/headless-wallet) and [Indexer](/api-references/indexer/overview) integration for your Unity Games, integrated with our own purpose-built for Unity SequenceEthereum library. That's right, no Nethereum required!

This SDK follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (`major.minor.patch`). Breaking changes will always cause a `major` version increment, non-breaking new features will cause a `minor` version increment, and bugfixes will cause a `patch` version increment.

## Requirements
Unity 2021.3.6f1 or later
- Android
- iOS
- PC standalone -> (Mono builds only when using Social Sign in -> the system commands throw exceptions when doing IL2CPP builds -> see [OpenIdAuthentication.PlatformSpecificSetup](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unity/blob/master/Packages/Sequence-Unity/Sequence/SequenceSDK/Authentication/OpenIdAuthenticator.cs.cs#L244))
- Mac standalone -> (Mono builds only when using Social Sign in -> in our testing MacOS doesn't pick up custom URL schemes automatically unless you run some system commands first; these system commands only work on Mono -> see [OpenIdAuthentication.PlatformSpecificSetup](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unity/blob/master/Packages/Sequence-Unity/Sequence/SequenceSDK/Authentication/OpenIdAuthenticator.cs#L244))
- WebGL
