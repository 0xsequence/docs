## Introduction

For advanced users with experience developing applications on EVM-based blockchains, we've provided our own lightweight, custom-made for Unity, Ethereum library: [SequenceEthereum](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unity/tree/master/Assets/SequenceSDK/Ethereum).
SequenceEthereum should provide everything you need to build your Unity app on the EVM, without all the extra bells and whistles that the popular [Nethereum](https://github.com/Nethereum/Nethereum) library provides.

While SequenceEthereum is heavily tested, in general, when working with asynchronous methods in the library, you should consider them to be "unsafe", in that they <i>may</i> throw Exceptions when used improperly.
In general, wrapping async calls that can potentially throw Exceptions in try catch blocks is a best practice; particularly in Unity, where `Tasks` can fail silently when throwing exceptions - making debugging difficult when not wrapping calls in try catch blocks.

### Important Components

When working with the SequenceEthereum library it can be helpful to understand some of the main "components" and how they logically fit together.

#### Client

Clients handle the connection to blockchain networks, making various RPC requests. Any time you wish to query the blockchain or submit a transaction, you will need a client. As a rule of thumb, if a method requires a client, you should expect that you will be making a web request and will need to work with async tasks and be prepared to catch any exceptions that are thrown.

#### Sequence.Wallet.IWallet

A wallet keeps track of its own private/public key pair and address and is responsible for providing its private key to the signer when signing transactions.

#### Transaction

A transaction, as implemented in `EthTransaction`, contains all the data and parameters for an EVM transaction. The object is used for initiating its [RLP encoding](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/rlp/) (transactions must be signed and RLP encoded when submitted). 

Note that all transactions are encoded with a chain id included to protect against replay attacks, see [EIP-155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-155).

#### Contract

A contract is responsible for creating transactions (for method calls) and messages (for queries) agaisnt it. These transactions are later signed by the wallet and submitted (along with query messages) using a client.
