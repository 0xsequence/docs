    Place this file in the root of a `Resources` folder.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate your Login Process">
    Start by establishing a wallet session using an email OTP. Import the `Setup` Sample from the Package Manager UI
      which will place a set of boilerplates into your project in a `Resources/` directory.
      Create the [Login Boilerplate](/sdk/unity/bootstrap_game#login) to send a one-time password to the specified email address.

    Once youâ€™ve your first features integrated, you can continue with [additional login providers](/sdk/unity/onboard/authentication/intro)
    such as Google, Apple, or PlayFab.

      ```csharp
      BoilerplateFactory.OpenSequenceLoginWindow(parent);
      ```

    <Step title="Test Sequence's Features">

Once everything is configured, you can create prefabs to display an Player Profile, Inventory, or In-Game Shop.
Checkout [how to integrate a Player Profile.](/sdk/unity/bootstrap_game#player-profile)
