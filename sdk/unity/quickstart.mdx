<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Unity SDK">
Install the latest version of Sequence's Unity SDK from [OpenUPM](/sdk/unity/installation#openupm),
or use [Unity's Package Manager UI](/sdk/unity/installation#or-using-package-manager-ui)
and use the following Git URL `https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unity.git?path=/Packages/Sequence-Unity`

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the SDK">
    Sign in and create a project on [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build).

    Download your config file from Builder as shown below.
    <Frame>

    </Frame>

    Place this file in the root of a `Resources` folder.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate your Login Process">
      Start by checking if a wallet session is available from storage:

      ```csharp
      bool recovered = await EmbeddedWalletAdapter.GetInstance().TryRecoverWalletFromStorage();
      ```

    If that returns `false` you should ask the user to sign. Import the `Setup` Sample from the Package Manager UI
      which will place a set of boilerplates into your project in a `Resources/` directory.
      Create the [Login Boilerplate](/sdk/unity/bootstrap_game#login) to send a one-time password to the specified email address.

    Once you’ve your first features integrated, you can continue with [additional login providers](/sdk/unity/onboard/authentication/intro)
    such as Google, Apple, or PlayFab.

      ```csharp
      BoilerplateFactory.OpenSequenceLoginWindow(parent);
      ```
    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/unity/unity_boilerplate_login.png" />
    </Frame>

  </Step>
    <Step title="Test Sequence's Features">
        Sequence's Unity SDK includes a variety of [Boilerplates](/sdk/unity/bootstrap_game) to help you quickly start your game.
        Once everything is configured, you can create prefabs to display an Player Profile, Inventory, or In-Game Shop.
        Checkout [how to integrate a Player Profile.](/sdk/unity/bootstrap_game#player-profile)

        ```csharp
        BoilerplateFactory.OpenSequencePlayerProfile(parent, wallet, chain);
        ```

    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/unity/unity_boilerplate_profile.png" />
    </Frame>

  </Step>
    <Step title="Integrate it on your own">
        Start with the `EmbeddedWalletAdapter` to quickstart your integration with a few one-liners and you are ready to go.
        When you want to customize your integration, checkout our other docs such as [authenticating users](/sdk/unity/onboard/authentication/intro) or [how to send transactions.](/sdk/unity/power/write-to-blockchain)

        ```csharp
        EmbeddedWalletAdapter adapter = EmbeddedWalletAdapter.GetInstance();

        // Recover your wallet from storage
        bool recovered = await adapter.TryRecoverWalletFromStorage();

        // Otherwise, create a new session via Google Sign-In
        bool successful = await adapter.GoogleLogin();

        // Next, let's send a transaction
        string recipientAddress = "0xabc123..";
        string currencyAddress = "0xabc123..";
        BigInteger amount = 1000;

        await adapter.SendToken(recipientAddress, amount, currencyAddress);
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
