A valid session is opened during the Authentication process.

Sequence Auth and Embedded Wallet handles the following aspects of your application:

- [Check Valid Session](/sdk/headless-wallet/manage-sessions#validation-status): Manage blockchain accounts to sign up or sign in users.
- [Control Session Validation](/sdk/headless-wallet/manage-sessions#control-session-validation): Authentication sessions to return important details to be consumed by your application to enhance the experience of games and applications.
- [Close Session](/sdk/headless-wallet/manage-sessions#close-session): Manage the listing and dropping of sessions handled by the WaaS stack.

## Validation status

To check the validation status of the current session, use the `isSessionValid` method. This returns `true` for email login and trusted social logins and `false` for custom logins until email validation is complete.

```ts
const isValid = await sequence.isSessionValid();
console.log(isValid);
```

```
true
```

### Trigger session validation

Manually trigger a session validation with the `validateSession` method. This will send a code to the user's email. If validated within 10 minutes, the method returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

```ts
const result = await sequence.validateSession();
```

```
true
```

Once user receives the code, he can validate the session with the `finishValidateSession` method that takes the code as an argument. If the code is valid, the method returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

```ts
const result = await sequence.finishValidateSession("123456");
```

```
true
```

### **Control Session Validation**
The **`onValidationRequired`** callback is used to determine the need for session validation during actions like sending transactions or signing messages. If the callback returns **`true`**, it triggers session validation. If it returns **`false`**, the related action is cancelled. This mechanism ensures that only validated sessions can proceed with sensitive operations.

```ts
const tx = await sequence.sendERC20({
  validation: {
    onValidationRequired: () => true,
  },
  chainId: 42161,
  token: "0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f", // DAI
  to: "0x27CabC9700EE6Db2797b6AC1e1eCe81C72A2cD8D", // Recipient
  value: "200000000000000000000", // 200 DAI
});
```

### Listen for session validations

Events like transaction sends may silently prompt session validation. Use the `onValidationRequired` hook to catch such instances.

```ts
sequence.onValidationRequired(() => {
  console.log("Session has been triggered for validation");
});

await sequence.sendTransaction({ chainId: 1 }, { to: "0x...", value: "1" });
```

```
Session has been triggered for validation
```

## Manage Automatic session validation
Automatic session validation occurs during actions that require validation. Manage this process using the onValidationRequired hook.  

```ts
const tx = await sequence.sendTransaction({
  chainId: 1,
  validation: {
    onValidationRequired: () => {
      console.log("Session has been triggered for validation");
      return true;
    },
  },
  to: "0x061150e5574716DBb1a2cdf54b3DcE9F94395f65",
  value: "1",
});
```

By returning `true` or `false` from the `onValidationRequired` hook, you either continue or cancel the action, respectively.

## Close Session

A session can be closed using the `id` of the session. Any session can be closed from any device with an active session.

```ts
import { SequenceWaaS } from '@0xsequence/waas'

const sequence = new SequenceWaaS({
  projectAccessKey: `${process.env.VITE_PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY}`,
  waasConfigKey: `${process.env.VITE_WAAS_CONFIG_KEY}`,
  network: 'arbitrum-nova'
})

await sequence.signIn({ idToken }, "MacBook Pro - Chrome")

const sessions = await sequence.listSessions()
await sequence.dropSession({ sessionId: sessions[0].id })
```
