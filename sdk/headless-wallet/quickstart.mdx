<Steps>
<Step title="Clone Starter Repo">
Run the following from your terminal to clone the starter repo.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Javascript
npx sequence-cli boilerplates create-email-embedded-wallet-react-starter
```

</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Connect and Authenticate">
Navigate to `localhost:4444` and enter your email to try out the authentication.
</Step>

<Step title="Add your embedded wallet keys">
Visit Sequence Builder and [configure your embedded wallet](/solutions/builder/embedded-wallet/configuration) to get keys specific to your project and authenticate your users. Simply replace the existing configuration keys in the .env file.
</Step>

<Step title="Use Sequence Embedded Wallets!">

Now that you have a working authentication, you can take look at our examples for the most common functions:
- [Sign messages](/sdk/headless-wallet/use-wallets#sign-messages)
- [Send transactions](/sdk/headless-wallet/use-wallets#send-transactions)
- [Call contracts](/sdk/headless-wallet/use-wallets#call-any-contract)
- [Verify a user on your backend](/sdk/headless-wallet/verification#prerequisite-deployment-of-a-parent-wallet)
</Step>
</Steps>


<Tip>
We are using example variables in the .env file, so we recommend creating a project on [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build/project/default/wallet/embedded-wallet) and [setting up your own wallet configuration](/sdk/headless-wallet) and update the environment variables to use more social providers for authentication, customize email templates, and more.
