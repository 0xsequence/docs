title: "Overview"
description: The [0xsequence](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence.js) package is versatile, working seamlessly on both browser/client and nodejs backends in Javascript or Typescript. For Go backends, the go-sequence SDK offers similar functionality, with all of Sequence's infrastructure built using go-sequence.

### Support for other backend languages

If your backend services are written in a language other than JS or Go, you can still easily integrate Sequence,
as Sequence is really just a standard Ethereum client library with some extra features. In many cases, the extra
features are best utilized on the client-side / dapp.

If your situation for example is a Python or Java backend where you'd like to verify signatures from a Sequence Wallet,
well then, you can call the standard [EIP1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) function for the account address
from your backend.

If you'd like to use the Sequence's Meta-Transaction capabilities, see [Building Relaying Server with Sequence](/guides/building-relaying-server).
