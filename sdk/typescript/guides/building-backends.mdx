title: "Building Backends with Sequence"
description: The 0xsequence package is versatile, working seamlessly on both browser/client and nodejs backends in Javascript or Typescript. For Go backends, the go-sequence SDK offers similar functionality, with all of Sequence's infrastructure built using go-sequence.

### nodejs

The [0xsequence](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence.js) package which is available for browser / client use, also works perfectly on nodejs backends
written in Javascript or Typescript.

### Go

A complete Sequence SDK is also available in Go: https://github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence.

[go-sequence](https://github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence) is the equivalent of [0xsequence](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence.js)
but for Go / Golang backends. In fact, all of Sequence's infrastructure is written in Go and is built with [go-sequence](https://github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence).


### ethkit

As part of the Sequence open source tools, our team has also built [ethkit](https://github.com/0xsequence/ethkit), which
is an Ethereum dev toolkit for Go backends. [ethkit](https://github.com/0xsequence/ethkit) supports EOA wallets,
and you can think of it like `ethers.js` but for Go.


### Support for other backend languages

If your backend services are written in a language other than JS or Go, you can still easily integrate Sequence,
as Sequence is really just a standard Ethereum client library with some extra features. In many cases, the extra
features are best utilized on the client-side / dapp.

If your situation for example is a Python or Java backend where you'd like to verify signatures from a Sequence Wallet,
well then, you can call the standard [EIP1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) function for the account address
from your backend.

If you'd like to use the Sequence's Meta-Transaction capabilities, see [Building Relaying Server with Sequence](/guides/building-relaying-server).
