description: How to bundle multiple transactions in a single native transaction.

Likewise, bundling multiple transactions to be sent in a single native transaction is equally as easy:

```ts
const transaction1 = {
  to: recipient1Address,
  value: 1000000000000000000
}

const transaction2 = {
  to: recipient2Address,
  value: 1000000000000000000
}

const signer = wallet.getSigner()
const response = await signer.sendTransaction([transaction1, transaction2])
console.log(response)
```

The transactions don't have to be the same token or even token standard either.
You can mix and match:

```ts
const erc20Interface = new ethers.Interface([
  'function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value)'
])
const erc721Interface = new ethers.Interface([
  'function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId)'
])
const erc1155Interface = new ethers.Interface([
  'function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes calldata _data)'
])

const erc20Data = erc20Interface.encodeFunctionData(
  'transfer', [recipient2Address, amount2]
)
const erc721Data = erc721Interface.encodeFunctionData(
  'safeTransferFrom', [address, recipient3Address, amount3]
)
const erc1155Data = erc1155Interface.encodeFunctionData(
  'safeTransferFrom', [address, recipient4Address, token4Id, amount4, '0x']
)

const transactions = [
  { to: recipient1Address, value: '1000000000000000000' },
  { to: daiContractAddress, data: erc20Data },
  { to: erc721ContractAddress, data: erc721Data },
  { to: erc1155ContractAddress, data: erc1155Data }
]

const signer = wallet.getSigner()
const response = await signer.sendTransaction(transactions)
console.log(response)
```
