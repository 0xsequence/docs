Sending an ERC-1155 collectible is similar to sending an ERC-20 token.
The only notable difference is in the contract standard itself:

```ts
const erc1155Interface = new ethers.Interface([
  'function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes calldata _data)'
])

// Encode the transfer of the collectible to recipient
const address = await wallet.getAddress()
const data = erc1155Interface.encodeFunctionData(
  'safeTransferFrom', [address, recipientAddress, tokenId, amount, '0x']
)

const transaction = {
  to: erc1155TokenAddress,
  data
}

const signer = wallet.getSigner()
const txnResponse = await signer.sendTransaction(transaction)
console.log(txnResponse)

```

With batching functionality, you can send multiple token transfers in a single native transaction:

```ts
const erc1155Interface = new ethers.Interface([
  'function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes calldata _data)'
])

// Encode two different ERC-1155 token transfers
const data1 = erc1155Interface.encodeFunctionData(
  'safeTransferFrom', [address, recipient1Address, token1Id, amount1, '0x']
)
const data2 = erc1155Interface.encodeFunctionData(
  'safeTransferFrom', [address, recipient2Address, token2Id, amount2, '0x']
)

const transaction1 = {
  to: erc1155ContractAddress,
  data: data1
}
const transaction2 = {
  to: erc1155ContractAddress,
  data: data2
}

// Send a multiple transactions as a single bundle which is executed as one transaction on-chain.
const signer = wallet.getSigner()
const txnResponse = await signer.sendTransactionBatch([transaction1, transaction2])
console.log(txnResponse)

```
