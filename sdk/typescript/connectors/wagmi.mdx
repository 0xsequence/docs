description: Use the Wagmi connector with the Sequence wallet. It includes installation instructions, usage details, parameters, and examples for different versions of Wagmi.
---

The Sequence wallet used with Wagmi through the connector.

<Note>
Try it live :)

[A live Dapp example](https://0xsequence.github.io/demo-dapp-wagmi/) using Sequence + Metamask + Wallet Connect with wagmi.

Source code is available too: [https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp-wagmi](https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp-wagmi)
</Note>

## Installation

The connector is installed via the npm package `@0xsequence/wagmi-connector`. If you are using the latest version of wagmi (>= 1.0.0) the latest version of the wagmi-connector package can be installed with the following command:

```shell
npm install @0xsequence/wagmi-connector 0xsequence ethers
```

or

```shell
yarn add @0xsequence/wagmi-connector 0xsequence ethers
```

## Usage

The connector is then imported and added to the list of connectors alongside the other wagmi connectors.

```js
import { sequenceWallet } from '@0xsequence/wagmi-connector';
import { configureChains, createConfig } from 'wagmi';
import { polygon } from 'wagmi/chains';
import { publicProvider } from 'wagmi/providers/public';

const chains: [Chain] = [polygon];

const connectors = [
  sequenceWallet({,
    walletAppURL: 'wallet_app_url',
    defaultNetwork: chains[0].id, // Polygon network ID,
    connectOptions: {
      app: 'Demo-app',
      projectAccessKey: 'your_project_access_key', // Replace with your actual project access key
    }
  }),
  // ...other connectors
];

const config = createConfig({
  chains,
  connectors,
  transports: {
    ...
  },
})

export default ({
    children
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) => {
  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={config}>
        {children}
    </WagmiProvider>
  )
}
```

## Parameters

### `walletAppURL`
Url of sequence wallet to connect to

### `defaultNetwork`
Chains supported by app. This is the same parameter as would be passed to other RainbowKit wallets.

### `connectOptions.app` (required)  
The name of the dapp, which will be displayed to the user on the connect screen.

### `connectOptions.appProtocol` (optional)  
A custom protocol used for authentication redirects, particularly for Unity and Unreal Engine integrations.

### `connectOptions.origin` (optional)  
The origin hint of the dapp’s host opening the wallet. This value is automatically determined and verified for integrity, so it can usually be omitted.

### `connectOptions.projectAccessKey` (optional)  
The access key for the project, which can be obtained from [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build). If the key is passed in `initWallet`, this value will be automatically populated.

### `connectOptions.expiry` (optional)  
The expiration time (in seconds) used for ETHAuth proof. The default is **1 week** (604800 seconds).

### `connectOptions.authorize` (optional)  
If set to `true`, the connection process will include an ETHAuth EIP-712 signing step and return the proof to the dapp.

### `connectOptions.authorizeNonce` (optional)  
A custom nonce value for ETHAuth proof, used for replay protection.

### `connectOptions.authorizeVersion` (optional)  
The SDK version that will validate the ETHAuth proof.

### `connectOptions.askForEmail` (optional)  
If set to `true`, the dapp will prompt the user for permission to access their email address.

### `connectOptions.refresh` (optional)  
If set to `true`, forces a full re-connect by disconnecting and then reconnecting the wallet.

### `connectOptions.keepWalletOpened` (optional)  
If set to `true`, the wallet window will remain open after connecting. By default, the wallet automatically closes after a successful connection.

### `connectOptions.clientVersion` (optional)  
Specifies the version of Sequence.js used by the dapp client.

### `connectOptions.settings` (optional)  
Additional options to customize the wallet experience.

## Using older versions of Wagmi (\<\= 0.12.x)

If you are using an older version of Wagmi (\<\= 0.12.x), which is based on ethers instead of viem, use the following command to install the appropriate version of the wagmi connector:

```shell
npm install @0xsequence/wagmi-connector@1.0 0xsequence ethers
```

or

```shell
yarn add @0xsequence/wagmi-connector@1.0 0xsequence ethers
```

## Using NextJs

There are special considerations to take into account when using Wagmi with NextJs such that it functions harmoniously with the server-side rendering of NextJs.
The correct technique to use differs depending on whether the application uses the older `pages` router or the more recent `app` router.

See [this section](https://docs.sequence.xyz/wallet/connectors/FAQ/#how-do-i-use-a-wallet-library-and-connector-with-nextjs-using-the-app-directory-version-13-and-above-only) for an explanation on using the Wagmi connector with `app` router.  
See [the example app](https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp-wagmi-next/tree/use-client-method) which uses the `app` router structure.

See [this section](https://docs.sequence.xyz/wallet/connectors/FAQ/#how-do-i-use-a-wallet-library-and-connector-with-nextjs-using-the-pages-directory-all-versions-of-nextjs) for an explanation on using the Wagmi connector with `pages` router.  
See [the example app](https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp-wagmi-next/tree/mount-hook) which uses the `pages` router structure.

## Examples

Below are example dapps using various versions of wagmi and libraries.

A demo app for the lastest version of Wagmi is available [here](https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp-wagmi/tree/wagmi-1-0-0).  
A demo app is available for older version of Wagmi(\<\=0.12.x) is available [here](https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp-wagmi/tree/wagmi-0-12-x).
