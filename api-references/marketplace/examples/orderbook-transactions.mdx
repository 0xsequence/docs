All transactions run through a contract at address `0xB537a160472183f2150d42EB1c3DD6684A55f74c` on all currently offered networks.

## Create a Request

In order to create a request with the sequence marketplace protocol, a prior transaction must take place where the token (ERC1155 or ERC721) you are submitting to the marketplace is approved to be transferred by the marketplace contract.

A batched transaction can be performed to fullfill this requirement of approval (transaction 1), while also sending the transaction for the creation of the request (transaction 2).

Using a universal wallet, this would look something like this:

## transaction 1: `setApprovalForAll`

- `operator`: (string) - address of the marketplace acting on the token
- `approved`: (bool) - the approval status of the operator

## transaction 2: `createRequest`

- `creator`: (string) - the wallet that is creating the order request
- `isListing`: (bool) - whether the order is to list (true) or offer orders (false)
- `isERC1155`: (bool) - whether the order is for an ERC1155 contract (false for ERC721s)
- `tokenContract`: (string) - the token you're looking to create an order for
- `tokenId`: (string) - the tokenId you're looking to create an order for
- `quantity`: (number) - the number of tokens you're looking to sell
- `expiry`: (number) - a number formated to ISO time
- `currency`: (string) - the ERC20 currency token you're transacting in
- `pricePerToken`: (big number) - the ERC20 price of the token in big number

### example

```js
const wallet = sequence.getWallet();
const signer = wallet.getSigner(421614); // on arbitrum-sepolia

const sequenceMarketInterface = new ethers.Interface(
  "function createRequest(tuple(bool isListing, bool isERC1155, address tokenContract, uint256 tokenId, uint256 quantity, uint96 expiry, address currency, uint256 pricePerToken)) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 requestId)"
);

const erc1155Interface = new ethers.Interface([
  "function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved) external",
]);

const amountBigNumber = ethers.parseUnits(String(price), 18); // currency price based on correct decimals for token contract

const request = {
  creator: await wallet.getAddress(),
  isListing: true,
  isERC1155: true,
  tokenContract: "0x1693ffc74edbb50d6138517fe5cd64fd1c917709", // collectible you're looking to list or create an offer for
  tokenId: selectedId,
  quantity: quantity,
  expiry: expiry,
  currency: "0xa9c88358862211870db6f18bc9b3f6e4f8b3eae7",
  pricePerToken: amountBigNumber,
};

const dataCreateRequest = sequenceMarketInterface.encodeFunctionData(
  "createRequest",
  [request]
);

const dataApprove = erc1155Interface.encodeFunctionData("setApprovalForAll", [
  "0xB537a160472183f2150d42EB1c3DD6684A55f74c", // sequence market contract (same address on all offered networks)
  true,
]);

const tx = {
  to: "0xB537a160472183f2150d42EB1c3DD6684A55f74c", // sequence market contract (same address on all offered networks)
  data: dataCreateRequest,
};

const txApprove = {
  to: "0x1693ffc74edbb50d6138517fe5cd64fd1c917709", // an ERC1155 token contract
  data: dataApprove,
};

await signer.sendTransaction([txApprove, tx]);
```

## Accept a Request

In order to accept an existing request, one would need to use one of the `get` requests endpoints (like [getTopOrders](/api-references-references-references-references-references/marketplace/examples/get-top-orders)) to acquire a `orderId` inputted into the `requestId` parameter to submit a transaction, with a prior transaction of approving the currency for the request.

A batched transaction can be performed to fullfill this requirement of currency approval (transaction 1), while also sending the transaction for the fullfillment of the request (transaction 2).

Using a universal wallet, this would look something like this:

## transaction 1: `approve`

- `spender`: (string) - address of the marketplace acting on the token
- `amount`: (bool) - the approval amount for the spender

## transaction 2: `acceptRequest`

- `requestId`: (string) - The ID of the request
- `quantity`: (bool) - The quantity of tokens to accept
- `additionalFees`: (number[]) - The additional fees to pay
- `additionalFeeRecipients`: (address[]) - the addresses to send the additional fees to

### example

```js
const wallet = sequence.getWallet();
const signer = wallet.getSigner(421614); // on arbitrum-sepolia

const erc20Interface = new ethers.Interface([
  "function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public returns (bool)",
]);

const sequenceMarketInterface = new ethers.Interface([
  "function acceptRequest(uint256 requestId, uint256 quantity, address recipient, uint256[] calldata additionalFees, address[] calldata additionalFeeRecipients)",
]);

const amountBigNumber = ethers.parseUnits(String(price), 18); // currency price based on correct decimals for token contract

const dataApprove = erc20Interface.encodeFunctionData("approve", [
  "0xB537a160472183f2150d42EB1c3DD6684A55f74c", // sequence market contract (same address on all offered networks)
  amountBigNumber,
]);

const dataAcceptRequest = sequenceMarketInterface.encodeFunctionData(
  "acceptRequest",
  [requestId, quantity, recipientAddress, [], []]
);

const txApprove = {
  to: "0xa9c88358862211870db6f18bc9b3f6e4f8b3eae7", // an ERC20 token contract
  data: dataApprove,
};

const tx = {
  to: "0xB537a160472183f2150d42EB1c3DD6684A55f74c", // sequence market contract (same address on all offered networks)
  data: dataAcceptRequest,
};

await signer.sendTransaction([txApprove, tx]);
