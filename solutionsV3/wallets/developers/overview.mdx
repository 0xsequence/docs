Sequence provides a powerful, layered set of tools that lets you build anything from a simple dApp with a pre-built wallet to a complex backend service that programmatically manages thousands of wallets.
Our tools are divided into two main categories to fit your needs:
- üåê **For the Frontend:** The Web SDK is an all-in-one, React Hooks solution for building user-facing applications. 
- ‚öôÔ∏è **For the Backend:** Sequence.js is our foundational set of libraries for server-side operations and custom, low-level wallet integrations.

## How Our SDKs Fit Together
