title: "React Native Embedded Wallet Demo"
description: Learn how to integrate the Sequence Embedded Wallet Mobile SDK in a React Native app for iOS and Android.
---


The following walkthrough implements the Sequence Embedded Wallet Mobile SDK for both iOS and Android. 

The walkthrough will explain how to clone a template repo and build an [Expo](https://expo.dev/) based app, which can be forked, so that a user can login with a [Gmail](https://console.cloud.google.com/) or [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/) email in a mobile application. 

This application enables users to sign messages and send transactions in a React Native Embedded Wallet application on `arbitrum-sepolia` network.

## Template
<Note>
Get started with a [template](https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-waas-react-native) leveraging the Sequence Embedded Wallet.

## Build Instructions

### Prequisites
::::steps   

#### Install Yarn

```shell
npm install --global yarn
```

#### Download Android Studio

Navigate yourself to the following [link to download Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

#### Download Java 22 SDK 

Navigate yourself to the following [link to download Java SDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

#### Set your Java SDK paths

If you're on macOS or Linux, set your java sdk path with the following lines in your `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`)

```shell
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

And run the following command to allow the changes to take effect

```shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Install XCode (if on macOS)

### Running the Project

::::steps
#### Clone repository

Begin by cloning the repository on your computer

```shell
git clone git@github.com:0xsequence/demo-waas-react-native.git
```

#### Create a Key File

Navigate into the `/android/app` folder with `cd` and run the following command to create a keystore

```
keytool -genkey -v -keystore debug.keystore -storepass android -alias androiddebugkey -keypass android -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -dname "CN=Android Debug,O=Android,C=US"
```

#### `yarn install`
`cd` into the root of the repository you cloned and run

```shell
yarn install
```

#### Open Project with Android Studio 
Open the project repository with Android Studio, and allow the editor to index and build the project

#### Run application on Android

Once the project has been compiled, `cd` into the root of the cloned repo and run

```shell
yarn android
```

#### Run application on iOS (if on macOS)

```shell
yarn ios 
```

Try signing in and sending some test transactions

#### Update WaaS Configuration

Finally, to allow the Embedded Wallet instance to create wallets when signing into your specific application, access the [following page](https://sequence.build/project/default/wallet/embedded-wallet) from your project to obtain a WaaS configuration key, and use [this walkthrough](/solutions/builder/embedded-wallet) to help explain the various angles of Embedded Wallet configuration to be updated in your code.

Then in the following path in the file `waasSetup.ts` from lines 5-13 update variables to your specific application you're building, with the `projectAccessKey` and `waasConfigKey` values from the Sequence Builder, and the Google social auth client ID's from the Google Console.

Next, update the `app.json` file on line 13 with the Apple `bundleIdentifier`

Finally, update lines 428 for `clientId` and line 432 for `redirectUri` in `App.tsx` from the Apple Developer Console.
