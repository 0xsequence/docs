# Intro to Cropout - Unreal Engine Game Guide


Cropout is a top-down casual RTS game built with Unreal Engine, in this guide we will walk you through how to integrate Embedded Wallet features using Sequence's Unreal SDK.

With this integration, players will be able to access features like smart contract wallets, in-game asset ownership, and transaction management—all without disruptive popups or gas fee requirements. 


Checkout the [Boilerplate for this guide.](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unreal)
[Learn more about Embedded Wallets.](/solutions/wallets/overview#what-are-the-differences-between-these-options)


## 1. Setup


### Download the game sample


If you have the Unreal Engine installed go straight to [Unreal's Cropout page.](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/cropout-casual-rts-game-sample-project).

If not then start by installing Epic Games Launcher:

1. Download and install the launcher from [Epic Games’ website.](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download).

2. Log In: Sign in or create an Epic Games account.

3. Find the Project: Go to the Unreal Engine tab, then the Learn section, and search for "Cropout Sample Project".

4. Download: Click Add to Library and then Install to download the project files.


## Download the Sequence Unreal Engine SDK

To get started, download the [latest version](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unreal/releases) of the Sequence SDK and put the `SequencePlugin` folder into your Unreal project's `Plugin` folder.

Alternatively, [get the SDK from the Epic Games Marketplace.](/sdk/unreal/v1/installation#using-epic-games-marketplace)

### Configure your Project

1. [Sign in to the Sequence Builder Console.](/solutions/builder/getting-started)

2. [Create a Project For Your Game in the Builder Console.](/support/builder/project-management)

3. Setup an [Embedded Wallet in the Builder Console.](/solutions/builder/embedded-wallet#embedded-wallet-in-builder)

4. In your `SequenceConfig.ini` file, add your `WaaS Config Key` and your Builder API Key from the [Builder Console](/solutions/builder/getting-started#claim-an-api-access-key) under `Settings > API Access Keys`.

5. Do not forget to add your preferred Oauth client ids, which you must set in the Builder under `Onboard > Embedded Wallet > Configuration`.


### Login using the Built-In UI


On the Main Menu level blueprint we will spawn our `Sequence Connector` Actor which will initiate and display the Login Panel. 

We recommend using the Built-In UI for development purposes, here's a more [detailed explanation. ](/sdk/unreal/v1/user_interfaces/)
For further customization, [learn how to create your own UI.](/sdk/unreal/v1/authentication/)


## 2. Setting the Network Id and Chain


To start our interaction with the Sequence SDK, open the *Sequence Connector* blueprint, locate the `Auth Success` event on *Event Graph > Begin Play*, and we will call `Api Update Network Id` from the SequenceWalletBP Subsystem to set the wallet to your builders project selected chain.
In the same event, we will also call `Set Chain` from the Sequence Indexer Subsystem so we can correctly fetch the assets.


## 3. Get Wallet address


To display the wallet's address we first retrieve the user's wallet reference again using the SequenceWalletBP and use it to fetch and display the wallet's address from the selected network using `Api GetWallet Address` from the SequenceWalletBP Subsystem. We will display the user address on UI_Layer_Menu.


## 4. Set your NFTs


In our case we are starting with an ERC-1155 contract, for our Resource Bundle packs and Farming Boosts. To create the NFTs go to [Builder Console >  Deploy > Contracts](/solutions/builder/contracts/) and select `Web3 Game Item`.

Once we've made our items we will now create their respective sale contracts by deploying a new contract and selecting `Web 3 Game Item(Sale)`. 

We will add to our Web 3 Game items its corresponding rewards and it's Sale contract address as a property.


### Fetching our NFTs 

To retrieve our newly created NFTs we will use the Indexer subsystem to call Get Token Supply, which will return us the information and metadata for the given contract address. You will find this in the `CUI_Purchase` blueprint.


### Purchasing an NFTs

To allow the player to purchase an NFT we will use the SequenceSDK subsystem to create and send a `PrimaryPurchase` transaction the desired `Web 3 Game Item(Sale)` and will use the contracts "Sale" property to reference our `Web 3 Game Item(Sale)`. You will find this in the `CUI_PurchaseItem` blueprint.

### Fetch the players NFTs

To retrieve the players NFTs will be using the Indexer Subsystem to call `Get Token Balances`, which will return us all the contract Balances for the given wallet address. Once returned, we will call Get Token Balances once again, but this time for each specific contract, which will return us the balance plus the information and metadata for the given contract. You will find this in the `CUI_Vault` blueprint.

### Burn the players NFTs

To give the player the rewards for using one of our NFTs we will use the SequenceSDK subsystem to create and send a `Burn` transaction of the desired `Web 3 Game Item` which will return us the transaction status and the contract address, to verify the success of the items burn. On Succes, we will use the contracts properties to give the players their reward. You will find this in the `CUI_VaultItem` blueprint.

## 5. Sign out the player


To  sign out the player and terminate his session we will call `Clear Session from the Sequence Sessions Subsytem, this way we will remove his stored credentials and the user will need to login again when he returns. We will be calling this method in the UI_Layer_Menu.
