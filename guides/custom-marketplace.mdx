title: "Build a Custom Marketplace"
description: This guide walks you through building a custom marketplace using the Sequence stack. It covers token minting, wallet authentication, displaying collections, creating and purchasing listings, making and accepting offers, and managing inventoryâ€”all seamlessly integrated with an embedded wallet and Sequence Kit.
sidebarTitle: Build a Custom Marketplace
---

In this guide we will go through the process of creating a custom marketplace from a few simple tools from the Sequence stack.

The tools will enable you to perform:

1. [Minting](/guides/custom-marketplace#1-minting): Minting of tokens to your wallet from the Sequence Builder
2. [Wallet Authentication](/guides/custom-marketplace#2-wallet-authentication): Use of Web SDK to authenticate a user
3. [Marketplace SDK setup](/sdk/marketplace-sdk/getting-started): Configure the Marketplace SDK to utilize its full range of tools
4. [Displaying collections](/guides/custom-marketplace#4-displaying-collections): Retrieve and display the marketplace's available collections.
5. [Listings and Purchase](/guides/custom-marketplace#5-listings-and-purchase): Enable users to list NFTs and purchase NFTs
6. [Offers and Accept offer](/guides/custom-marketplace#6-offers-and-accept-offer): Enable users to make offers for NFTs and accept offers for NFTs
7. [(Optional) Inventory](/guides/custom-marketplace#6-inventory-optional): Add a inventory for your users

<Note>
See an example [simplified marketplace dapp](https://simple-marketplace-boilerplate.pages.dev/) that enables users to mint collectibles, sell the collectibles with the Sequence Marketplace Protocol, and make purchases with USDC on `base-sepolia` by getting a top order from the Marketplace.

The code can be found [here](https://github.com/0xsequence-demos/simple-marketplace-boilerplate)

</Note>

## 1. Minting

The first step is to create a collectible from the Sequence Builder and mint a few tokens, which can be accomplished with this [guide](/sdk/collectibles/deploy-an-item-collection) and to use the `tokenId` you minted in the following steps to query and fulfill orders.

## 2. Wallet Authentication

For your project, you'll need a way to authenticate your user with a wallet.

For this guide we'll use an `Embedded Wallet` with `Web SDK` connector which can authenticate users using Google or Apple auth, in addition to user brought wallets like Coinbase or Metamask. To start this integration follow [Web SDK getting started](/sdk/web/getting-started)

#### Run and Test

Congratulations on making it this far! You can now run pnpm dev to test your authentication and everything you've implemented so far.

<Warning>
  Be sure to include a `.env` file in the root of your project to include client secrets
</Warning>

## 3. Marketplace SDK setup

To start using the Marketplace SDK, you need to initialize the Marketplace SDK to access all its available tools.

To start this integration follow [Marketplace SDK getting started](/sdk/marketplace-sdk/getting-started)

#### Run and Test

Congratulations on making it this far! You can now run pnpm dev to test your authentication and everything you've implemented so far.

<Warning>
  Be sure to include a `.env` file in the root of your project to include client secrets
</Warning>

## 4. Displaying collections

To display the marketplace collections, use the `useMarketplaceConfig` hook. Create your landing page and refer to the [useMarketplaceConfig documentation](/sdk/marketplace-sdk/hooks/use-list-collectibles#usemarketplaceconfig) to retrieve the necessary information for displaying your collections

## 5. Listings and Purchase

This section is for integrating the listings and purchase from our marketplace into our UI.

To create the Items page and its components, follow the [useListCollectibles hook](/sdk/marketplace-sdk/hooks/use-list-collectibles#uselistcollectibles) to retrieve your listed and unlisted NFTs. Once you have fetched the data, build a simple UI to display your NFTs and proceed to the next step.

Now that your NFTs are displayed, you need to list them to make them available in your marketplace. To do this, refer to the [useCreateListingModal hook documentation](/sdk/marketplace-sdk/hooks/marketplace-actions#usecreatelistingmodal). The `useCreateListingModal` hook allows you to list an item for sale on the Marketplace. Try it! Once you have successfully listed an NFT, you can continue.

To make a purchase, use the useBuyModal hook. This hook is used to purchase NFTs listed for sale on the Marketplace, handling the buying process and transaction execution. Follow the [useBuyModal documentation](/sdk/marketplace-sdk/hooks/marketplace-actions#usebuymodal) to integrate it into your marketplace.

## 6. Offers and Accept offer

This section is for integrating the offers and accept offers from our marketplace into our UI.

To create the Offers page and its components, follow the [PENDING HOOK](https://www.google.com) to retrieve NFTs that have received offers as well as those without any offers. Once you have fetched the data, build a simple UI to display the NFTs along with their offers, then proceed to the next step.

Now that your NFTs and their offers are displayed, you may want to allow users to make new offers. To do this, refer to the [useMakeOfferModal hook documentation](/sdk/marketplace-sdk/hooks/marketplace-actions#usemakeoffermodal). The useMakeOfferModal hook enables users to place offers on NFTs within the Marketplace. Try it! Once offers can be made, you can move on.

To finalize sales based on accepted offers, use the useSellModal hook. This hook allows users to accept an offer and complete the sale of an NFT. Follow the [useSellModal documentation](/sdk/marketplace-sdk/hooks/marketplace-actions#usesellmodal) to integrate it into your marketplace.

## 7. Inventory (Optional)

To access the user's inventory, you can refer to the following documentation: [Sequence Inventory Modal](/sdk/web/hooks/useOpenWalletModal#useopenwalletmodal). Everything is set up, and you only need to invoke the inventory modal.

If you prefer to build a custom UI using APIs, you can retrieve token balances through the following endpoint: [Get Token Balances API](https://docs.sequence.xyz/api/indexer/endpoints#tag/public/POST/rpc/Indexer/GetTokenBalances).
