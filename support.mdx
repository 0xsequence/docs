Sequence has a front line Support Team in multiple timezones to tackle problems that arise with the Stack, as well as answer any question for new projects in order to integrate web3 experiences in games and applications.

If one of the members of the team does not know the answer, we'll further investigate (with backup support from the Sequence dev team) to get to the bottom of your troubles.
